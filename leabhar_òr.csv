Stereodescriptors, used in a number of different ways. 1. Relative stereodescriptors used in carbohydrate nomenclature to describe the configuration at
the anomeric carbon by relating it to the anomeric reference atom. For simple cases the anomeric reference atom is the same as the configurational reference atom. Thus in -D-glucopyranose the reference atom is C-5 and the OH at C-1 is on the same side as the OH at C-5 in the Fischer projection.
2. Relative stereodescriptors used by Chemical Abstracts Service to describe the configuration of a cyclic molecule (including suitable polycyclic systems) with several stereogenic centres whereby the  side of the reference plane is the side on which the substituent with CIP priority lies at the lowest numbered stereogenic centre. The other side is .

3. Absolute stereodescriptors originally devised for steroid nomenclature. However in this sense it is only meaningful if there is an agreed absolute configuration and orientation of the structure so as to define the plane and which way up the molecule is represented. Substituents above the plane

of the steroid are described as  and are shown as a solid line (

or

); those below

the plane are described as  and are shown by a broken line (

or ). The extension

of this system to tetrapyrroles has been documented and it has been widely used elsewhere.

actinic flux

The quantity of light available to molecules at a particular point in the atmosphere and

which, on absorption, drives photochemical processes in the atmosphere. It is calculated

by integrating the spectral radiance

overall directions of incidence of the light,

. If the radiance is expressed in

and is the energy per quantum of light of wavelength , the actinic flux has units of

. This important quantity is one of the terms required in the calculation of j-
values, the first order rate coefficients for photochemical processes in the sunlight-absorbing, trace gases in the atmosphere. The actinic flux is determined by the solar radiation entering the atmosphere and by any changes in this due to atmospheric gases and particles (e.g. Rayleigh scattering absorption by stratospheric ozone, scattering and absorption by aerosols and clouds), and reflections from the ground. It is therefore dependent on the wavelength of the light, on the altitude and on specific local environmental conditions. The actinic flux has borne many names (e.g. flux, flux density, beam irradiance actinic irradiance, integrated intensity) which has caused some confusion. It is important to distinguish the actinic flux from the spectral irradiance, which refers to energy arrival on a flat surface

having fixed spatial orientation (

) given by:

.

The actinic flux does not refer to any specific orientation because molecules are oriented randomly in the atmosphere. This distinction is of practical relevance: the actinic flux (and therefore a j-value) near a brightly reflecting surface (e.g. over snow or above a thick cloud) can be a factor of three higher than that near a non-reflecting surface. The more descriptive name of spectral spheradiance is suggested for the quantity herein called actinic flux. See also: flux density, photon

activated adsorption process
If the temperature coefficient of the rate of adsorption is substantial, an adsorption process is said to be activated (i.e. to have a significant activation energy). In this case, the sticking coefficient is small. In general, the activation energy of activated adsorption is a function of coverage and it usually increases with increasing coverage.

activated carbon
A porous carbon material, a char which has been subjected to reaction with gases, sometimes with the addition of chemicals, e.g. ZnCl2, before, during or after carbonization in order to increase its adsorptive properties. Note: Activated carbons have a large adsorption capacity, preferably for small molecules, and are used for purification of liquids and gases. By controlling the process of carbonization and activation, a variety of active carbons having different porosity can be obtained. Activated carbons are used mainly in granular and powdered forms, but can also be produced in textile form by controlled carbonization and activation of textile fibres. Other terms used in the literature: active carbons, active charcoals.

adiabatic
Also contains definition of: nonadiabatic
This word is used with various different meanings, and when it is used it should be defined. In thermodynamics 'adiabatic' is used in a macroscopic sense to refer to a process occurring in a thermally insulated system, so that there is no flow of heat to or from the surroundings. In reaction dynamics, the word has been used in a microscopic sense, with a range of meanings which have only a tenuous relationship to the thermodynamic meaning or the etymology. Whereas the thermodynamic meaning relates to conditions imposed on a process by an observer, the microscopic meaning relates to conditions under which the process occurs naturally. The microscopic meanings, as used in reaction dynamics, all have in common the feature that quantum states remain unchanged during the course of reaction. Different quantum states may be referred to: 1. A reaction in which there is no change of electronic state or multiplicity has been called adiabatic,
or more specifically electronically adiabatic. 2. A reaction in which there is no change of vibrational state during the course of reaction has been
said to be vibrationally adiabatic. More loosely, the expression has been applied to a process in which excess vibrational energy in the reactants appears as vibrational energy in the products, or in which ground-state vibration in the reactants leads to ground state vibration in the products. 3. A reaction in which excess rotational energy in the reactants appears as rotational energy in the products, or in which ground-state rotation in the reactants leads to ground-state rotation in the products, has been referred to as rotationally adiabatic. 4. In the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory of unimolecular reactions, a degree of freedom whose quantum number is more or less preserved during energization and subsequent reaction has been called 'adiabatic'; the word 'inactive' has also been applied to it. A reaction that is not adiabatic is referred to as nonadiabatic or diabatic, and some workers make a distinction between the two words. See also: diabatic coupling

As a consequence, glass-like carbon with visible pores is still an agranular carbon. The same is true, for instance, for pyrolytic carbon with preferred orientation, such as conical or lamellar structures, visible in optical microscopy with polarized light. Use of the term agranular carbon is not restricted to bulk materials of a minimum size.

ambident
Also contains definitions of: multident, polydent
A description applied to a chemical species whose molecular entities each possess two alternative and strongly interacting distinguishable reactive centres, to either of which a bond may be made in a reaction: the centres must be connected in such a way that reaction at either site stops or greatly retards subsequent attack at the second site. The term is most commonly applied to conjugated nucleophiles, for example the enolate ion:

(which may react with electrophiles either at the -carbon atom or at oxygen) or -pyridones, and also to the vicinally ambident cyanide ion, cyanate ion, thiocyanate ion, sulfinate ion, nitrite ion and unsymmetrical hydrazines. Ambident electrophiles are exemplified by carboxylic esters RC(=O)OCR3 which react with nucleophiles either at the carbonyl carbon or the alkoxy carbon. Molecular entities, such as dianions of dicarboxylic acids, containing two non-interacting (or feebly interacting) reactive centres, are not generally considered to be ambident and are better described as 'bifunctional'. The Latin root of the word implies two reactive centres, but the term has in the past also incorrectly been applied to chemical species with more than two reactive centres. For such species the existing term 'polydent' (or, better, 'multident') is more appropriate. See also: chelation

in a polypeptide
When two or more amino acids combine to form a peptide, the elements of water are removed, and what remains of each amino acid is called an amino-acid residue. -Amino-acid residues are therefore structures that lack a hydrogen atom of the amino group (­NH­CHR­COOH), or the hydroxyl moiety of the carboxyl group (NH2­CHR­CO­), or both (­NH­CHR­COO­); all units of a peptide chain are therefore amino-acid residues. (Residues of amino acids that contain two amino groups or two carboxyl groups may be joined by isopeptide bonds, and so may not have the formulas shown.) The residue in a peptide that has an amino group that is free, or at least not acylated by another amino-acid residue (it may, for example, be acylated or formylated), is called N-terminal; it is at the N-terminus. The residue that has a free carboxyl group, or at least does not acylate another amino-acid residue, (it may, for example, acylate ammonia to give ­NH­CHR­CO­NH2), is called C-terminal.

amorphous carbon

A carbon material without long-range crystalline order. Short-range order exists, but with deviations of the interatomic distances and/or interbonding angles with respect to the graphite lattice as well as to the diamond lattice. Note: The term amorphous carbon is restricted to the description of carbon materials with localized electrons as described by P.W.Anderson (Phys. Rev., 1958, 109, 1492). Deviations in the C­C

distances greater than 5% (i.e.

, where is the inter-atomic distance in the crystal lattice

for the as well as for the configuration) occur in such materials, as well as deviations in the

bond angles because of the presence of 'dangling bonds'. The above description of amorphous carbon

is not applicable to carbon materials with two-dimensional structural elements present in all pyrolysis

residues of carbon compounds as polyaromatic layers with a nearly ideal interatomic distance of

and an extension greater than

.

amount concentration,

Amount of a constituent divided by the volume of the mixture. Also called amount-of-substance concentration, substance concentration (in clinical chemistry) and in older literature molarity. For

entities B it is often denoted by . The common unit is mole per cubic decimetre (

) or

mole per litre (

) sometimes denoted by .

amount fraction, ( for gaseous mixtures)
Synonym: mole fraction
Amount of a constituent divided by the total amount of all constituents in the mixture. It is also called mole fraction. Amount fraction is equal to the number fraction: the number of entities of one constituent divided by the total number of entities in the mixture. See also: fraction
Source: Green Book, 2nd ed., p. 41

amount of substance,

Also contains definition of: number of moles

Base quantity in the system of quantities upon which SI is based. It is the number of elementary entities

divided by the Avogadro constant. Since it is proportional to the number of entities, the proportionality

constant being the reciprocal Avogadro constant and the same for all substances, it has to be treated

almost identically with the number of entities. Thus the counted elementary entities must always be

specified. The words 'of substance' may be replaced by the specification of the entity, for example:

amount of chlorine atoms, , amount of chlorine molecules,

. No specification of the entity

might lead to ambiguities [amount of sulfur could stand for , , etc.], but in many cases

the implied entity is assumed to be known: for molecular compounds it is usually the molecule [e.g.

amount of benzene usually means

], for ionic compounds the simplest formula unit [e.g.

amount of sodium chloride usually means

] and for metals the atom [e.g. amount of silver

usually stands for

]. In some derived quantities the words 'of substance' are also omitted, e.g.

amount concentration, amount fraction. Thus in many cases the name of the base quantity is shortened to amount and to avoid possible confusion with the general meaning of the word the attribute chemical is added. The chemical amount is hence the alternative name for amount of substance. In the field of clinical chemistry the words 'of substance' should not be omitted and abbreviations such as substance concentration (for amount of substance concentration) and substance fraction are in use. The quantity had no name prior to 1969 and was simply referred to as the number of moles.

amphipathic
The property of surface activity is usually due to the fact that the molecules of the substance are amphipathic or amphiphilic, meaning that each contains both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic (lipophilic) group. This assumes that one of the two phases is aqueous, and the other non-aqueous. If both are non-aqueous (e.g. oil/air), molecules containing organophilic and organophobic groups may be amphipathic and surface active.

antarafacial
Also contains definition of: suprafacial
When a part of a molecule ('molecular fragment') undergoes two changes in bonding (bond-making or bond-breaking), either to a common centre or to two related centres, external to itself, these bonding changes may be related in one of two spatially different ways. These are designated as 'antarafacial' if opposite faces of the molecular fragment are involved, and 'suprafacial' if both changes occur at the same face. The concept of 'face' is clear from the diagrams in the cases of planar (or approximately planar) frameworks with isolated or interacting p-orbitals [diagrams (a) and (b)].

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

93 of 1622

The terms antarafacial and suprafacial are, however, also employed in cases in which the essential part of the molecular fragment undergoing changes in bonding comprises two atoms linked only by a -bond. In these cases it is customary to refer to the phases of the local -bonding orbital: occurrence of the two bonding changes at sites of like orbital phase is regarded as suprafacial, whereas that at two sites of opposite phase is antarafacial. The possibilities are shown for C­C and C­H bonds in diagrams (c) and (d). There may be two distinct and alternative stereochemical outcomes of a suprafacial process involving a -bond between saturated carbon atoms, i.e. either retention or inversion at both centres. The antarafacial process results in inversion at one centre and retention at the second. For examples of the use of these terms, see cycloaddition, sigmatropic rearrangement.

anti
In the representation of stereochemical relationships 'anti' means 'on opposite sides' of a reference plane, in contrast to 'syn' which means 'on the same side', as in the following examples. 1. Two substituents attached to atoms joined by a single bond are anti if the torsion angle (dihedral
angle) between the bonds to the substituents is greater than 90°, or syn if it is less than 90°. (A further distinction is made between antiperiplanar, synperiplanar, anticlinal and synclinal.)

antiaromaticity (antithetical to aromaticity)
Those cyclic molecules for which cyclic electron delocalization provides for the reduction (in some cases, loss) of thermodynamic stability compared to acyclic structural analogues are classified as antiaromatic species. In contrast to aromatic compounds, antiaromatic ones are prone to reactions causing changes in their structural type, and display tendency to alternation of bond lengths and fluxional behavior (see fluxional molecules) both in solution and in the solid. Antiaromatic molecules possess negative (or very low positive) values of resonance energy and a small energy gap between their highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. In antiaromatic molecules, an external magnetic field induces a paramagnetic electron current. Whereas benzene represents the prototypical aromatic compound, cyclobuta-1,3-diene exemplifies the compound with most clearly defined antiaromatic properties.

The three equivalent bonds (or positions) in a plane passing through the central atom and perpendicular to the direction of the apical bonds are described as equatorial. (See axial, equatorial for alternative use). The term apical is also used for the bond pointing from the atom at or near the centre of the base to the apex of a pyramidal structure. The positions at or near the base of the pyramid, or the bonds linking those positions to the central atom of the base are described as basal. The apical bonds have also been called axial.

apicophilicity
In trigonal bipyramidal structures with a five-coordinate central atom, the stabilization achieved through a ligand changing its position from equatorial to apical (axial). The apicophilicity of an atom or a group is evaluated by either the energy difference between the stereoisomers (permutational isomers) containing the ligand in apical and equatorial positions or the energy barrier to permutational isomerization (see also Berry pseudorotation). In general, the greater the electronegativity and the stronger the -electron-withdrawing properties of a ligand (as for Cl, F, CN), the higher is its apicophilicity. The notion of apicophilicity has been extended to four-coordinate bisphenoidal and three-coordinate T-shaped structures, which can be viewed as trigonal bipyramidal species where, respectively, one or two vertices are occupied by phantom ligands (lone electron pairs).

aromaticity
The concept of spatial and electronic structure of cyclic molecular systems displaying the effects of cyclic electron delocalization which provide for their enhanced thermodynamic stability (relative to acyclic structural analogues) and tendency to retain the structural type in the course of chemical transformations. A quantitative assessment of the degree of aromaticity is given by the value of the resonance energy. It may also be evaluated by the energies of relevant isodesmic and homodesmotic reactions. Along with energetic criteria of aromaticity, important and complementary are also a structural criterion (the lesser the alternation of bond lengths in the rings, the greater is the aromaticity of the molecule) and a magnetic criterion (existence of the diamagnetic ring current induced in a conjugated cyclic molecule by an external magnetic field and manifested by an exaltation and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility). Although originally introduced for characterization of peculiar properties of cyclic conjugated hydrocarbons and their ions, the concept of aromaticity has been extended to their homoderivatives (see homoaromaticity), conjugated heterocyclic compounds (heteroaromaticity), saturated cyclic compounds (-aromaticity) as well as to three-dimensional organic and organometallic compounds (three-dimensional aromaticity). A common feature of the electronic structure inherent in all aromatic molecules is the close nature of their valence electron shells, i.e., double electron occupation of all bonding MOs with all antibonding and delocalized nonbonding MOs unfilled. The notion of aromaticity is applied also to transition states.

asymmetric transformation
Also contains definition of: deracemization
The conversion of a racemate into a pure enantiomer or into a mixture in which one enantiomer is present in excess, or of a diastereoisomeric mixture into a single diastereoisomer or into a mixture in which one diastereoisomer predominates. This is sometimes called deracemization. If the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate A are freely interconvertible and if an equal amount or excess of a non-racemizing second enantiomerically pure chemical species, say (R)-B, is added to a solution of racemic A, then the resulting equilibrium mixture of adducts A · B will, in general, contain unequal amounts of the diastereoisomers (R)-A · (R)-B and (S)-A · (R)-B. The result of this equilibration is called asymmetric transformation of the first kind. If, in such a system, the two diastereoisomeric adducts differ considerably in solubility so that only one of them, say (R)-A · (R)-B, crystallizes from the solution, then the equilibration of diastereoisomers in solution and concurrent crystallization will continue so that all (or most) of the substrate A can be isolated as the crystalline diastereoisomer (R)-A · (R)-B. Such a 'crystallization-induced asymmetric transformation' is called an asymmetric transformation of the second kind. See also: stereoconvergence

axial (equatorial)
Also contains definitions of: pseudo-axial, pseudo-equatorial, quasi-axial, quasi-equatorial
In the chair form of cyclohexane ring bonds to ring atoms (and molecular entities attached to such bonds) are termed axial or equatorial according to whether the bonds make a relatively large or small angle, respectively, with the plane containing or passing closest to a majority of the ring atoms. Thus the axial bonds are approximately parallel to the C3 axis and the equatorial bonds approximately parallel to two of the ring bonds. These terms are also used for the chair form of other saturated sixmembered rings. The corresponding bonds occurring at the allylic positions in mono-unsaturated sixmembered rings are termed pseudo-axial (or quasi-axial) and pseudo-equatorial (or quasi-equatorial). The terms axial and equatorial have similarly been used in relation to the puckered conformation of cyclobutane, crown conformer of cyclooctane, etc. and the terms pseudo-axial and pseudo-equatorial in the context of the non-planar structures of cyclopentane and cycloheptane.

aza-di--methane rearrangement
Photochemical reaction of a 1-aza-1,4-diene or a 2-aza-1,4-diene in the triplet excited state to form the corresponding cyclopropylimine. Note: The rearrangement formally amounts to a 1,2-shift of the imino group and 'bond formation' between the C(3) and C(5) carbon atoms of the azadiene skeleton. 1-Aza-1,4-dienes also undergo the rearrangement to cyclopropylimines using electron-acceptor and electron-donor sensitizers via radical-cation and radical-anion intermediates, respectively. 2-Aza-1,4-dienes rearrange to Nvinylaziridines on irradiation using electron-acceptor sensitizers. In this instance the reaction amounts to a 1,2-shift of the alkene unit and "bond formation" between the C(1) and C(3) carbon atoms of the azadiene skeleton.

biradical
An even-electron molecular entity with two (possibly delocalized) radical centres which act nearly independently of each other, e.g.

Species in which the two radical centres interact significantly are often referred to as 'biradicaloids'. If the two radical centres are located on the same atom, the species are more properly referred to by their generic names: carbenes, nitrenes, etc. The lowest-energy triplet state of a biradical lies below or at most only a little above its lowest singlet state (usually judged relative to , the product of the
Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature ). The states of those biradicals whose radical
centres interact particularly weakly are most easily understood in terms of a pair of local doublets. Theoretical descriptions of low-energy states of biradicals display the presence of two unsaturated valences (biradicals contain one fewer bond than permitted by the rules of valence): the dominant valence bond structures have two dots, the low energy molecular orbital configurations have only two electrons in two approximately nonbonding molecular orbitals, two of the natural orbitals have occupancies close to one, etc. Although this term has been recommended in the past for diradicals, specialists working in the field prefer the latter term. See also: carbenes, nitrenes

bond energy
in theoretical chemistry
The energy required to break a given type of bond between atoms in certain valence states. An averaged bond energy is commonly derived by dissecting the heat of atomization of a molecule into contributions of individual bonds. For molecules with localized bonds, the heats of atomization (formation) are usually well approximated by the sum of pertinent averaged bond energies.

bond length

The distance between atomic centers involved in a chemical bond. The notion of bond length is defined differently in various experimental methods of determination of molecular geometry; this leads to

small (usually

­

) differences in bond lengths obtained by different techniques. For

example, in gas-phase electron-diffraction experiments, the bond length is the interatomic distance

averaged over all occupied vibrational states at a given temperature. In an X-ray crystal structural

method, the bond length is associated with the distance between the centroids of electron densities

around the nuclei. In gas-phase microwave spectroscopy, the bond length is an effective interatomic

distance derived from measurements on a number of isotopic molecules, etc. A number of empirical

relationships between bond lengths and bond orders in polyatomic molecules were suggested, see, for

example, fractional bond number (the Pauling's bond order).

bond order
The electron population in the region between atoms A and B of a molecular entity at the expense of electron density in the immediate vicinity of the individual atomic centers. Different schemes of partitioning electron density give rise to different definitions of bond orders. In the framework of the Mulliken population analysis, bond order is associated with the total overlap population
where and are respectively the elements of the density matrix and overlap matrix (see overlap integral). A large positive value of bond order signifies strong bonding between the atoms of the molecular entity, whereas negative values of imply that electrons are displaced away from the inter-atomic region and point to an anti-bonding interaction. In valence bond theory, bond order is given by a weighted average of the formal bond orders (i.e. by the number of electron pairs in a given Lewis structure) between the atoms in the resonance structures (see resonance hybrid).

bridged carbocation
A carbocation (real or hypothetical) in which there are two (or more) carbon atoms that could in alternative Lewis formulae be designated as carbenium centres but which is instead represented by a structure in which a group (a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon residue, possibly with substituents in non-involved positions) bridges these potential carbenium centres. One may distinguish 'electronsufficient bridged carbocations' and 'electron-deficient bridged carbocations'. Examples of the former are phenyl-bridged ions (for which the trivial name 'phenonium ion' has been used), such as (A). These ions are straightforwardly classified as carbenium ions. The latter type of ion necessarily involves three-centre bonding. Structures (C) and (D) contain five-coordinate carbon atoms. The 'hydrogen-bridged carbocation' (B) contains a two-coordinate hydrogen atom. Hypercoordination, which includes two-coordination for hydrogen and five- but also higher coordination for carbon is generally observed in bridged carbocations.

Brooks and Taylor structure
The structure of the anisotropic spheres which precipitate from isotropic pitch during pyrolysis. The structure of the spheres consists of a lamellar arrangement of aromatic molecules in parallel layers which are perpendicular to the polar axis of the sphere and which are perpendicular to the mesophase-isotropic phase interface. Note: The term Brooks and Taylor structure is recommended to describe the particular lamellar morphology of the spherules most commonly precipitated from pyrolysed pitch. The term honours the workers who first recognized the significance of carbonaceous mesophase to carbon science and technology and who first defined this spherical morphology. The term Brooks and Taylor structure does not cover all structures found in the spherical mesophase, because other lamellar arrangements have been observed.

of the acid HA, is the number of equivalent acidic protons in the acid HA, and is the number

Although justifiable on historical grounds, this name is not recommended, since Brønsted relations are known to apply to many uncatalysed and pseudo-catalysed reactions (such as simple proton (hydron) transfer reactions). The term 'pseudoBrønsted relation' is sometimes used for reactions which involve nucleophilic catalysis instead of
acid­base catalysis. Various types of Brønsted parameters have been proposed such as , ,

carbenium ion
A generic name for carbocations, real or hypothetical, that have at least one important contributing structure containing a tervalent carbon atom with a vacant p-orbital. (The name implies a protonated carbene or a substitution derivative thereof.) The term was proposed (and rejected) as a replacement for the traditional usage of the name carbonium ion. To avoid ambiguity, the name should not be used as the root for the systematic nomenclature of carbocations. The corresponding difficulty confused carbonium ion nomenclature for many years. For example, the term 'ethylcarbonium ion' has at times been used to refer either to CH3CH2+ (ethyl cation) or (correctly) to CH3CH2CH2+ (propyl cation).

An electrode for an electrical application. In its green state it comprises granular carbon material

bound with pitch. The granular carbon material may be either needle coke, fine-grained or isotropic

coke or reclaimed graphite powder. Electrodes for use in steel production can only be manufactured

from needle coke, and the green electrodes are fired at temperatures above around

carbon fibres type HM

Carbon fibres type HM (high modulus) are carbon fibres with a value of Young's modulus (tensile

modulus) larger than

(nearly 30% of the elastic constant of a graphite single crystal).

Note:

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

208 of 1622

The level of the tensile modulus of carbon fibres is controlled by the degree of preferred orientation of the layer planes in the direction parallel to the fibre axis. , the elastic constant of graphite single

crystals in the direction of the layer planes, is

. In general, the ratio of tensile strength

to tensile modulus is smaller than

for carbon fibres type HM (but the tensile strength is

influenced by flaws in the fibres and may be improved in the future). Carbon fibres type UHM (ultra-

high modulus) have moduli of elasticity in excess of

, surpassing 50% of the theoretical

number. Such high values of Young's modulus can be achieved most readily in mesophase pitch-

carbon fibres type HT

Carbon fibres type HT are carbon fibres with values of Young's modulus between and to

type display the highest tensile strengths. Note: The disposition of boundaries between the fibre types is somewhat arbitrary. For carbon fibres type

HT, the values of the strength-to-stiffness ratio are typically larger than

. The tensile

strength of carbon fibres is flaw-controlled, however, and therefore the measured values increase

strongly as the diameter of the filaments is decreased.

carbon fibres type IM

Carbon fibres type IM (intermediate modulus) are related to carbon fibres type HT because of the comparable values of tensile strength, but are characterized by greater stiffness (Young's modulus up
to approximately 35% of the theoretical value).

Note:

The tensile modulus (Young's modulus) varies between ca. and

, but the disposition

of the boundaries is somewhat arbitrary. The relatively high ratio of tensile strength to tensile

modulus, typically above

, in carbon fibres type IM, in spite of an increase of Young's

modulus, requires a further increase of strength, which is achievable by a significant reduction of the

monofilament diameter down to about

. Such small filament diameters are typical of carbon

fibres type IM.

carbonaceous mesophase
A liquid-crystalline state of pitch which shows the optical birefringence of disc-like (discotic) nematic liquid crystals. It can be formed as an intermediate phase during thermolysis (pyrolysis) of an isotropic molten pitch or by precipitation from pitch fractions prepared by selective extraction. Generally, the spherical mesophase precipitated from a pyrolysing pitch has the Brooks and Taylor structure. With continuous heat treatment the carbonaceous mesophase coalesces to a state of bulk mesophase before solidification to green coke with further loss of hydrogen or low-molecular-weight compounds. Note: In the formation of carbonaceous mesophase by thermolysis (pyrolysis) of isotropic molten pitch, the development of a liquid-crystalline phase is accompanied by simultaneous aromatic polymerization reactions. The reactivity of pitch with increasing heat treatment temperature and its thermosetting nature are responsible for the lack of a true reversible thermotropic phase transition for the bulk mesophase in most pitches. Due to its glass-like nature most of the liquid-crystalline characteristics are retained in the super-cooled solid state.

carbonization

A process by which solid residues with increasing content of the element carbon are formed from

organic material usually by pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere.

Note:

As with all pyrolytic reactions, carbonization is a complex process in which many reactions take place

concurrently such as dehydrogenation, condensation, hydrogen transfer and isomerization. It differs

from coalification in that its reaction rate is faster by many orders of magnitude. The final pyrolysis

temperature applied controls the degree of carbonization and the residual content of foreign elements,

e.g. at

the carbon content of the residue exceeds a mass fraction of 90 wt.%, whereas

at more than 99 wt.% carbon is found.

catalyst
Also contains definitions of: heterogeneous catalysis, homogeneous catalysis
A substance that increases the rate of a reaction without modifying the overall standard Gibbs energy change in the reaction; the process is called catalysis. The catalyst is both a reactant and product of the reaction. The words catalyst and catalysis should not be used when the added substance reduces the rate of reaction (see inhibitor ). Catalysis can be classified as homogeneous catalysis, in which only one phase is involved, and heterogeneous catalysis, in which the reaction occurs at or near an interface between phases. Catalysis brought about by one of the products of a reaction is called autocatalysis. Catalysis brought about by a group on a reactant molecule itself is called intramolecular catalysis. The term catalysis is also often used when the substance is consumed in the reaction (for example: base-catalysed hydrolysis of esters). Strictly, such a substance should be called an activator.

catalytic current
The faradaic current that is obtained with a solution containing two substances B and A may exceed the sum of the faradaic currents that would be obtained with B and A separately, but at the same concentrations and under the same experimental conditions. In either of the two following situations the increase is termed a catalytic current. B is reduced or oxidized at the electrode-solution interface to give a product B' that then reduces or oxidizes A chemically. The reaction of B with A may yield either B or an intermediate in the overall half-reaction by which B' was obtained from B. In this situation the increase of current that results from the addition of A to a solution of B may be termed a regeneration current. The presence at the electrode-solution interface of one substance, which may be either A or the product A' of its reduction or oxidation, decreases the over-potential for the reduction or oxidation of B. In either case the magnitude of the catalytic current depends on the applied potential. If the current observed with a mixture of A and B is smaller than the sum of the separate currents, the term non-additive current should be used.

chain polymerization
Also contains definition of: condensative chain polymerization
A chain reaction in which the growth of a polymer chain proceeds exclusively by reaction(s) between monomer(s) and reactive site(s) on the polymer chain with regeneration of the reactive site(s) at the end of each growth step. Notes: 1. A chain polymerization consists of initiation and propagation reactions, and may also include
termination and chain transfer reactions. 2. The adjective 'chain' in 'chain polymerization' denotes a 'chain reaction' rather than a 'polymer
chain'. 3. Propagation in chain polymerization usually occurs without the formation of small molecules.
However, cases exist where a low-molar-mass by-product is formed, as in the polymerization of oxazolidine-2,5-diones derived from amino acids (commonly termed amino-acid N-carboxy anhydrides). When a low-molar-mass by-product is formed, the adjective 'condensative' is recommended to give the term condensative chain polymerization 4. The growth steps are expressed by:

where denotes the growing chain of degree of polymerization , a monomer and a low-
molar-mass by-product formed in the case of condensative chain polymerization. 5. The term 'chain polymerization' may be qualified further, if necessary, to specify the type of
chemical reactions involved in the growth step, e.g. ring-opening chain polymerization, cationic chain polymerization.

proceeds via a radical chain reaction with intermolecular transfer of the radical centre. The growth step, however, involves reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization and, hence, the polymerization is classified as a polyaddition.

same term is applied to similar conformations of analogous saturated six-membered ring structures containing hetero-atoms and/or bearing substituent groups, but these conformations may be distorted from the exact D3d symmetry. For cyclohexane and most such analogues, the chair form is the most
stable conformation. If the cyclohexane conformation has no centre of symmetry but possesses two planes of symmetry, one of them bisecting the bonds between atoms 1 and 2 and between 4 and 5 and the other plane passing through atoms 3 and 6 (which lie out of the plane and on the same side of the plane containing 1, 2, 4 and 5), that conformation (of symmetry group C2v ) is called a boat

is called the twist form (also known as skew boat, skew form and stretched form). See also: half-chair

In a five-membered ring a conformation in which two adjacent atoms are maximally displaced, in opposite directions, relative to the plane containing the other three carbon atoms has been called a half-chair but is better called a twist conformation.

Synonym: characteristic X-radiation
X-ray emission originates from the radiative decay of electronically highly excited states of matter. Excitation by electrons is called primary excitation and by photons, secondary or fluorescence excitation. Particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) is produced by the excitation of heavier particles such as protons, deuterons or heavy atoms in varying degrees of ionization. Emission of photons in the X-ray wavelength region also occurs from ionized gases or plasmas at high temperatures, from nuclear processes (low-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum) and from radiative transitions between muonic states. Characteristic X-ray emission consists of a series of X-ray spectral lines with discrete frequencies, characteristic of the emitting atom. Other features are emission bands from transitions to valence levels. In a spectrum obtained with electron or photon excitation the most intense lines are called diagram lines or normal X-ray lines. They are dipole allowed transitions between normal Xray diagram levels.

The terms bidentate (or didentate), tridentate, tetradentate, ... multidentate are used to indicate the number of potential binding sites of the ligand, at least two of which must be used by the ligand in forming a 'chelate'. For example, the bidentate ethylenediamine forms a chelate with CuI in which both nitrogen atoms of ethylenediamine are bonded to copper. (The use of the term is often restricted to metallic central atoms.) The phrase 'separate binding sites' is intended to exclude cases such as [PtCl3(CH2=CH2)]-, ferrocene and (benzene)tricarbonylchromium in which ethene, the cyclopentadienyl group and benzene, respectively, are considered to present single binding sites to the respective metal atom, and which are not normally thought of as chelates.

chemical bond
When forces acting between two atoms or groups of atoms lead to the formation of a stable independent molecular entity, a chemical bond is considered to exist between these atoms or groups. The principal characteristic of a bond in a molecule is the existence of a region between the nuclei of constant potential contours that allows the potential energy to improve substantially by atomic contraction at the expense of only a small increase in kinetic energy. Not only directed covalent bonds characteristic of organic compounds, but also bonds such as those existing between sodium cations and chloride anions in a crystal of sodium chloride or the bonds binding aluminium to six molecules of water in its environment, and even weak bonds that link two molecules of O2 into O4, are to be attributed to chemical bonds.

chemical relaxation
Also contains definition of: T-jump
If the equilibrium mixture of a chemical reaction is disturbed by a sudden change, especially of some external parameter (such as temperature, pressure or electrical field strength), the system will readjust itself to a new position of the chemical equilibrium or return to the original position, if the perturbation is temporary. The readjustment is known as chemical relaxation. In many cases, and in particular when the displacement from equilibrium is slight, the progress of the system towards equilibrium can be expressed as a first-order law:
where and are the equilibrium concentrations of one of the chemical species involved
in the reaction before and after the change in the external parameter, and is its concentration at time . The time parameter , named relaxation time, is related to the rate constants of the chemical reaction involved. Measurements of the relaxation times by relaxation methods [involving a temperature jump (T-jump), pressure jump, electric field jump or a periodic disturbance of an external parameter, as in ultrasonic techniques] are commonly used to follow the kinetics of very fast reactions.

tetramethylsilane (TMS), strictly speaking in dilute solution in CDCl3. Other references are used in the

older literature and for other solvents, such as D2O. Resonance lines to high frequency from the TMS

signal have positive, and resonance lines to low frequency from TMS have negative, -values (arising

from relative deshielding and shielding respectively). The archaic terms 'downfield' and 'upfield'

should no longer be used. For nuclei other than 1H, chemical shifts are expressed either in the same

manner relative to an agreed substance containing the relevant nucleus or relative to the 1H resonance

of TMS as values, defined in the references below.

chemical species
An ensemble of chemically identical molecular entities that can explore the same set of molecular energy levels on the time scale of the experiment. The term is applied equally to a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array. For example, two conformational isomers may be interconverted sufficiently slowly to be detectable by separate NMR spectra and hence to be considered to be separate chemical species on a time scale governed by the radiofrequency of the spectrometer used. On the other hand, in a slow chemical reaction the same mixture of conformers may behave as a single chemical species, i.e. there is virtually complete equilibrium population of the total set of molecular energy levels belonging to the two conformers. Except where the context requires otherwise, the term is taken to refer to a set of molecular entities containing isotopes in their natural abundance. The wording of the definition given in the first paragraph is intended to embrace both cases such as graphite, sodium chloride or a surface oxide, where the basic structural units may not be capable of isolated existence, as well as those cases where they are. In common chemical usage generic and specific chemical names (such as radical or hydroxide ion) or chemical formulae refer either to a chemical species or to a molecular entity.

circular dichroism (CD)
A spectroscopic method which measures the difference in absorbance of left- and right-handed circularly polarised light by a material, as a function of the wavelength. Most biological molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, are chiral and show circular dichroism in their ultraviolet absorption bands, which may be used as an indication of secondary structure. Metal centres that are bound to such molecules, even if they have no inherent chirality, usually exhibit CD in absorption bands associated with ligand-based or ligand-metal charge-transfer transitions. CD is frequently used in combination with absorption and MCD studies to assign electronic transitions.

cis, trans
Descriptors which show the relationship between two ligands attached to separate atoms that are connected by a double bond or are contained in a ring. The two ligands are said to be located cis to each other if they lie on the same side of a plane. If they are on opposite sides, their relative position is described as trans. The appropriate reference plane of a double bond is perpendicular to that of the relevant -bonds and passes through the double bond. For a ring (the ring being in a conformation, real or assumed, without re-entrant angles at the two substituted atoms) it is the mean plane of the ring(s).

For alkenes the terms cis and trans may be ambiguous and have therefore largely been replaced by the E,Z convention for the nomenclature of organic compounds. If there are more than two entities attached to the ring the use of cis and trans requires the definition of a reference substituent.

coalification

A geological process of formation of materials with increasing content of the element carbon

from organic materials that occurs in a first, biological stage into peats, followed by a gradual

transformation into coal by action of moderate temperature (about

) and high pressure in a

Note:

Coalification is a dehydrogenation process with a reaction rate slower by many orders of magnitude

than that of carbonization. Some specific reactions approach completion before others have started.

The dehydrogenation remains incomplete. The degree of coalification reached by an organic material

in the process of coalification increases progressively and can be defined by means of the measured

C/H ratio and of the residual contents of oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen.

coefficient of haze (
in atmospheric chemistry

)

One technique of measurement of the amount of filterable particulate matter suspended in air which

has been used in the past depends upon drawing a measured sample of air (usually 1 000 linear feet)

through a paper or membrane filter. A measurement is made of the intensity of light transmitted

through the dust spot formed relative to that transmitted through an identical clean filter. The dirtiness

of the air is reported in terms of the

unit. This relates to the quantity of particulate material

which produces an optical density,

of 0.01 when measured by light transmission at

and relative to the transmission of an identical

dust-free filter taken as 100%. Thus a filter which transmitted 50% relative to the clean filter has an

absorbance of 0.301 or 30.1

units. This is not a recommended measure of filterable particulate

matter since the size, colour and other properties of the aerosol and the air in which it is suspended

affect the results.

The distance over which order is maintained. As an example, there can be long-range atomic or molecular order, i.e. coherence. Coherence lengths are significantly larger than molecular size. Normally, coherence length is estimated from electron, neutron or X-ray scattering and scales the size of ordered domains in material where long range ordering occurs (as in liquid crystals, for example). The term coherence length is also used for the scale characterizing the profile of molecular axis orientation in the distorted, so-called, transition layers formed at a solid/liquid-crystal boundary when an appropriate external field is applied (e.g. when the orientation of anchored surface molecules of a nematic liquid crystal is unaffected by an external field -- magnetic or electric -- whereas the bulk molecules reorient freely). This scale is referred to as electric coherence length, or magnetic
coherence length, , depending on the nature of the applied field.

collision theory
Various collision theories, dealing with the frequency of collision between reactant molecules, have been put forward. In the earliest theories reactant molecules were regarded as hard spheres, and a collision was considered to occur when the distance between the centres of two molecules was equal to the sum of their radii. For a gas containing only one type of molecule, A, the collision density is given by simple collision theory as:

Here is the number density of molecules and is the mean molecular speed, given by kinetic

theory to be

collisional broadening
Also contains definitions of: foreign-gas broadening, resonance broadening of a spectral line
, van der Waals broadening of a spectral line

Collisions of the emitting or absorbing particle with other particles cause collisional broadening as well as collisional shift of the spectral line. When collisions occur between unlike, neutral particles the term foreign-gas broadening is used, or van der Waals' broadening when both collision partners are neutral. When the colliding particles are of the same species, the term resonance broadening is employed. The term Lorentz broadening was previously used for neutral particle collision broadening, and Holtsmark broadening for cases of van der Waals' broadening when collisions took place with like particles. Both terms are now discouraged. Stark broadening refers to collisions with charged particles or particles with a strong permanent electrical dipole moment. Whereas a strong chaotic electrical field causes Stark broadening, an applied static electrical field induces a Stark shift.

commensurate­incommensurate transition

Also contains definition of: lock-in state

A transition between two states having magnetic or crystallographic structures with a basic lattice and an imposed super-periodicity. In the commensurate (lock-in) state this super-periodicity is a simple rational multiple of the basic unit cell. In the incommensurate state the ratio of the super-periodicity repeat distance to the basic lattice repeat distance is irrational and may show continuous variation with variation in some degree of freedom (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition) of the system. Example: The transition of Rb2ZnCl4 from an incommensurate structure to a commensurate structure
at the lock-in temperature, , which is dependent on the crystal growth method and varies in the

range

to .

For example, the rate of solvolysis of diphenylmethyl chloride in acetone- water is reduced by the addition of salts of the common ion Cl- which causes a decrease in the quasi-equilibrium concentration of the diphenylmethyl cation in the scheme:

component
Constituent of a mixture the amount or concentration of which can be varied independently. The number of components in a given system is the minimum number of independent species necessary to define the composition in all the phases of a system. It may vary with external conditions since additional chemical equilibria reduce the number of components. The term component is also often used in the more general sense as defined here under constituent.

composite mechanism
Also contains definition of: negative feedback
A reaction that involves more than one elementary reaction is said to occur by a composite mechanism. The terms complex mechanism, indirect mechanism, and step-wise mechanism are also commonly used. There are two main kinds of evidence for a composite mechanism: 1. The kinetic equation for the reaction does not correspond to its stoichiometry. 2. There is experimental evidence, direct or indirect, for intermediates of such a nature that it is
necessary to conclude that more than one elementary reaction is involved. There are many types of composite mechanisms, for example: 1. Reactions occurring in parallel, such as:

are called parallel reactions or simultaneous reactions. When there are simultaneous reactions there is sometimes competition, as in the scheme:

composite reaction
A chemical reaction for which the expression for the rate of disappearance of a reactant (or rate of appearance of a product) involves rate constants of more than a single elementary reaction. Examples are 'opposing reactions' (where rate constants of two opposed chemical reactions are involved), 'parallel reactions' (for which the rate of disappearance of any reactant is governed by the rate constants relating to several simultaneous reactions to form different respective products from a single set of reactants), and stepwise reactions.

composition of pure air
in atmospheric chemistry
The composition of air is variable with respect to several of its components (e.g. CH4, CO2, H2O) so 'pure' air has no precise meaning; it is commonly considered to be air which is free of dust, aerosols and reactive gaseous contaminants of anthropogenic origin. The composition of the major components in dry air is relatively constant (percent by volume given): nitrogen, 78.084; oxygen, 20.946; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide, 0.033; neon, 0.0018; helium, 0.000524; methane, 0.00016; krypton, 0.000114; hydrogen 0.00005; nitrous oxide, 0.00003; xenon, 0.0000087. The concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the chlorofluorocarbons and some other species of anthropogenic origin are increasing measurably with time. Relative clean air which is free of most reactive anthropogenic pollution (NO, NO2, SO2, non-methane hydrocarbons, etc.), often used as a reference sample in the calibration and operation of instruments, is purchased under the designation of zero air.

conical intersection
Point of crossing between two electronic states of the same spin multiplicity (most commonly singlets or triplets). Notes: 1. In a polyatomic molecule two potential energy surfaces are allowed to cross along a (3N - 8)-
dimensional subspace of the (3N - 6)-dimensional nuclear coordinate space (the intersection space) even if they have the same spatial/spin symmetry (N is the number of nuclei). Each point of the intersection space corresponds to a conical intersection. If the energy is plotted against two special internal geometrical coordinates, x1 and x2, which define the so-called branching plane, the potential energy surface would have the form of a double cone in the region surrounding the degeneracy. In the remaining (3N - 8) directions, the energies of the ground and excited state remain degenerate; movement in the branching plane lifts the degeneracy. 2. From a mechanistic point of view, conical intersections often provide the channel mediating radiationless deactivation and photochemical reaction.

conjugated system (conjugation)
In the original meaning a conjugated system is a molecular entity whose structure may be represented as a system of alternating single and multiple bonds: e.g. CH2=CH­CH=CH2, CH2=CH­CN. In such systems, conjugation is the interaction of one p-orbital with another across an intervening bond in such structures. (In appropriate molecular entities d-orbitals may be involved.) The term is

The definition is based on the valence-bond formulation of the quantum mechanical idea of the wavefunction of a molecule as composed of a linear combination of wavefunctions, each representative of a formula containing bonds that are only single, double or triple with a particular pairing of electron spins. Each such formula represents a contributing structure, also called 'resonance structure' to the total wavefunction, and the degree to which each contributes is indicated by the square of its coefficient in the linear combination. The contributing structures, also called 'canonical forms', themselves thus have a purely formal significance: they are the components from which wavefunctions can be built. Structures may be covalent (or non-polar) or ionic (or polar). The representation is frequently kept qualitative so that we speak of important or major contributing

Curtin­Hammett principle

In a chemical reaction that yields one product (X) from one conformational isomer (A') and a different product (Y) from another conformational isomer (A'') (and provided these two isomers are rapidly interconvertible relative to the rate of product formation, whereas the products do not undergo interconversion) the product composition is not in direct proportion to the relative concentrations of the conformational isomers in the substrate ; it is controlled only by the difference in standard free

energies (

) of the respective transition states.

It is also true that the product composition is formally related to the relative concentrations of the conformational isomers A' and A'' (i.e. the conformational equilibrium constant) and the respective rate constants of their reactions; these parameters are generally -- though not invariably -- unknown. The diagram below represents the energetic situation for transformation of interconverting isomers A and A' into products X and Y.

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

367 of 1622

1. A(i + j + ...) cycloaddition is a reaction in which two or more molecules (or parts of the same molecule), respectively, provide units of i, j, ... linearly connected atoms: these units become joined at their respective termini by new -bonds so as to form a cycle containing (i + j + ...) atoms. In this notation, (a) a Diels­Alder reaction is a (4+2) cycloaddition, (b) the initial reaction of ozone with an alkene is a (3+2) cycloaddition, and (c) the reaction shown below is a (2+2+2) cycloaddition. (N.B.: parentheses (...) are used in the description based on numbers of atoms.)

2. The symbolism [i + j + ...] for a cycloaddition identifies the numbers i, j, ... of electrons in the interacting units that participate in the transformation of reactants to products. In this notation the reaction (a) and (b) of the preceding paragraph would both be described as [2+4] cycloadditions, and (c) as a [2+2+2] cycloaddition. The symbol a or s (a = antarafacial, s = suprafacial) is often added (usually as a subscript after the number to designate the stereochemistry of addition to each fragment. A subscript specifying the orbitals, viz. ,  (sigma, pi) with their usual significance) or n (for an orbital associated with a single atom only), may be added as a subscript before

the number. Thus the normal Diels­Alder reaction is a

or

cycloaddition,

whilst the reaction:

sample and of the crystalline fraction, respectively. 4. The degree of crystallinity can be determined by several experimental techniques; among the
most commonly used are: (i) X-ray diffraction, (ii) calorimetry, (iii) density measurements, and (iv) infrared spectroscopy (IR). Imperfections in crystals are not easily distinguished from the amorphous phase. Also, the various techniques may be affected to different extents by imperfections and interfacial effects. Hence, some disagreement among the results of quantitative measurements of crystallinity by different methods is frequently encountered.

delayed coking process

A thermal process which increases the molecular aggregation or association in petroleum-based

.

Note:

Needle coke is the premium product of the delayed coking process. It is generally produced from

highly aromatic residues from, for instance, the steam cracking of gas oil. Its appearance and preferred

orientation of the graphene layers is a consequence of the evolved gaseous products percolating

through the mesophase which must not have too high a viscosity. A close control of temperature, time

and feedstock is essential. Lower grades, for instance isotropic cokes, are used for carbon electrodes

applied, for example, in the production of aluminium.

delayed fluorescence
Also contains definition of: recombination fluorescence
Three types of delayed fluorescence are known: 1. E-type delayed fluorescence: The process in which the first excited singlet state becomes
populated by a thermally activated radiationless transition from the first excited triplet state. Since in this case the populations of the singlet and triplet states are in thermal equilibrium, the lifetimes of delayed fluorescence and the concomitant phosphorescence are equal. 2. P-type delayed fluorescence: The process in which the first excited singlet state is populated by interaction of two molecules in the triplet state (triplet-triplet annihilation ) thus producing one molecule in the excited singlet state. In this biphotonic process the lifetime of delayed fluorescence is half the value of the concomitant phosphorescence. 3. Recombination fluorescence: The first excited singlet state becomes populated by recombination of radical ions with electrons or by recombination of radical ions of opposite charge.

Luminescence decaying more slowly than that expected from the rate of decay of the emitting state. The following mechanisms of luminescence provide examples: 1. triplet-triplet or singlet-singlet annihilation to form one molecular entity in its excited singlet
state and another molecular entity in its electronic ground state (sometime referred to as P type), 2. thermally activated delayed fluorescence involving reversible intersystem crossing (sometimes
referred to as E type), and 3. combination of oppositely charged ions or of an electron and a cation. For emission to be referred
to in this case as delayed luminescence at least one of the two reaction partners must be generated in a photochemical process. See also: delayed fluorescence

deliquescence
The process that occurs when the vapour pressure of the saturated aqueous solution of a substance is less than the vapour pressure of water in the ambient air. When water vapour is collected by the pure solid compound, a mixture of the solid and liquid or an aqueous solution of the compound forms until the substance is dissolved and is in equilibrium with its environment; at this time the vapour pressure of water over the aqueous solution will equal the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere in contact with it. A crystalline salt aerosol particle will deliquesce in the atmosphere when the relative humidity surpasses a characteristic value, the so-called deliquescence point.

delocalization
A quantum mechanical concept most usually applied in organic chemistry to describe the -bonding in a conjugated system. This bonding is not localized between two atoms: instead, each link has a 'fractional double bond character' or bond order. There is a corresponding 'delocalization energy', identifiable with the stabilization of the system compared with a hypothetical alternative in which formal (localized) single and double bonds are present. Some degree of delocalization is always present and can be estimated by quantum mechanical calculations. The effects are particularly evident in aromatic systems and in symmetrical molecular entities in which a lone pair of electrons or a vacant p-orbital is conjugated with a double bond (e.g. carboxylate ions, nitro compounds, enamines, the allyl cation). Delocalization in such species may be represented by partial bonds or as resonance (here symbolized by a two-headed arrow) between contributing structures.

These examples also illustrate the concomitant delocalization of charge in ionic conjugated systems. Analogously, delocalization of the spin of an unpaired electron occurs in conjugated radicals. See also: mesomerism

Diamond by CVD can be prepared in a variety of ways. Deposition parameters are: total (low) pressure, partial hydrogen pressure, precursor molecules in the gas phase, temperature for activation of the hydrogen and that of the surface of the underlying substrate. The energy supply for the hydrogen activation

may be, for instance: heat, radio frequency, microwave excitation (plasma deposition) or accelerated ions (e.g. Ar+ ions). CVD diamond has also been obtained at atmospheric pressure from oxyacetylene torches and by other flame-based methods. Often CVD carbon films consist of a mixture of - and
-hybridized carbon atoms and do not have the three-dimensional structure of the diamond lattice. In this case they should be called hard amorphous carbon or diamond-like carbon films.

diamond-like carbon films
Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are hard, amorphous films with a significant fraction of -hybridized carbon atoms and which can contain a significant amount of hydrogen. Depending
on the deposition conditions, these films can be fully amorphous or contain diamond crystallites. These materials are not called diamond unless a full three-dimensional crystalline lattice of diamond is proven. Note: Diamond-like films without hydrogen can be prepared by carbon ion beam deposition, ion-assisted sputtering from graphite or by laser ablation of graphite. Diamond-like carbon films containing significant contents of hydrogen are prepared by chemical vapour deposition. The hydrogen content is usually over 25 atomic %. The deposition parameters are (low) total pressure, hydrogen partial pressure, precursor molecules and plasma ionization. The plasma activation can be radio frequency, microwave or Ar+ ions. High ionization favours amorphous films while high atomic hydrogen contents favour diamond crystallite formation. Because of the confusion about structure engendered by the term diamond-like carbon films, the term hard amorphous carbon films has been suggested as a synonym.

diffusion
The spreading or scattering of a gaseous or liquid material. Eddy diffusion in the atmosphere is the process of transport of gases due to turbulent mixing in the presence of a composition gradient. Molecular diffusion is the net transport of molecules which results from their molecular motions alone in the absence of turbulent mixing; it occurs when the concentration gradient of a particular gas in a mixture differs from its equilibrium value. Eddy diffusion is the most important mixing process in the lower atmosphere, while molecular diffusion becomes significant at the lower pressures of the upper atmosphere.

diffusion current (or diffusion-controlled current)
A faradaic current whose magnitude is controlled by the rate at which a reactant in an electrochemical process diffuses toward an electrode-solution interface (and, sometimes, by the rate at which a product diffuses away from that interface). For the reaction mechanism
there are two common situations in which a diffusion current can be observed. In one, the rate of formation of B from electroinactive C is small and the current is governed by the rate of diffusion of B toward the electrode surface. In the other, C predominates at equilibrium in the bulk of the solution, but its transformation into B is fast; C diffuses to the vicinity of the electrode surface and is there rapidly converted into B, which is reduced.

437 of 1622

1. Distribution functions may be discrete, i.e. take on only certain specified values of the random variable(s), or continuous, i.e. take on any intermediate value of the random variable(s), in a given range. Most distributions in polymer science are intrinsically discrete, but it is often convenient to regard them as continuous or to use distribution functions that are inherently continuous.
2. Distribution functions may be integral (or cumulative), i.e. give the proportion of the population for which a random variable is less than or equal to a given value. Alternatively they may be differential distribution functions (or probability density functions), i.e. give the (maybe infinitesimal) proportion of the population for which the random variable(s) is (are) within a (maybe infinitesimal) interval of its (their) range(s).
3. Normalization requires that: (i) for a discrete differential distribution function, the sum of the function values over all possible values of the random variable(s) be unity; (ii) for a continuous differential distribution function, the integral over the entire range of the random variable(s) be unity; (iii) for an integral (cumulative) distribution function, the function value at the upper limit of the random variable(s) be unity.

are

usually expressed per unit volume of the phase; may also be expressed per mass of the dry solid

distribution ratio,
in liquid-liquid distribution
The ratio of the total analytical concentration of a solute in the extract (regardless of its chemical form) to its total analytical concentration in the other phase. Notes: 1. If there is possible confusion with the extraction factor or (mass) distribution ratio the term
concentration distribution ratio (symbol ) should be used, but this is not common usage. This
is reasonably compatible with chromatographic nomenclature. 2. The terms distribution coefficient, extraction coefficient and, where appropriate, scrubbing
coefficient, stripping coefficient are widely used alternatives but are not recommended. If they must be used in a given situation the term ratio is preferable to coefficient.

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

438 of 1622

3. In equations relating to aqueous/organic systems the organic phase concentration is, by convention, the numerator and the aqueous phase concentration the denominator. In the case of stripping ratio the opposite convention is sometimes used but should then be clearly specified.
4. In the past there has been much confusion between the distribution ratio as defined above, the value of which varies with experimental conditions, e.g. , presence of complexing agents, extent of achievement of equilibrium etc. and the true partition coefficient which is by definition invariable or the partition coefficient or distribution constant which apply to a particular chemical species under specified conditions. For this reason the terms distribution constant, partition constant, partition coefficient, partition ratio and extraction constant should not be used in this context.
5. The use of the ratio: light phase concentration to heavy phase concentration is ambiguous and is not recommended.
6. The distribution ratio is an experimental parameter and its value does not necessarily imply that distribution equilibrium between the phases has been achieved.

mass spectrum
Processes of the charge-stripping type:

If the instrument slits are wide and if the electric sector field is set to half the value required to transmit the main ion-beam, the only ions to be transmitted will be those with a kinetic energy/charge ratio half, or almost exactly half, that of the main ion beam. The product ions of the charge-stripping process fulfil this condition. If the magnetic field is scanned, a mass spectrum of such doubly-charged product ions, and thus of their singly-charged precursors, is obtained. Such a spectrum is called an mass spectrum.

electrified interphase
An interphase between phases containing free charged components which are usually accumulated or depleted in the surface region thus giving rise to net charges on the phase. This definition includes the special case when the net charge on each of the phases reduces to zero. Charged components may or may not cross the interface between two phases, so that interphases may be divided into the limiting types unpolarizable and polarizable, respectively. Ideally unpolarizable interphases are those for which the exchange of common charged particles between the phases proceeds unhindered. Ideally polarizable interphases are those for which there are no common components between the phases or the exchange of these is hindered. This condition may arise as a result of the equilibrium conditions or from the kinetics of charge transfer and leads to an interphase which is impermeable to electric charge. Real interphases may approach more or less well one of these idealized cases. Polarisibility or non-polarisibility is not an absolute property of an interphase but depends on a number of conditions, e.g. time scale of the experiment.

Photochemical process in which a reaction of a non-absorbing substrate is induced by electron transfer (not energy transfer) with an excited light-absorbing sensitizer. The overall process must be such that the sensitizer is recycled. Depending on the action of the excited sensitizer as electron donor or acceptor the sensitization is called reductive or oxidative.

electron-transfer catalysis
The term indicates a sequence of reactions such as shown in equations (1)­(3), leading from A to B : (1) (2) (3)

An analogous sequence involving radical cations (A+., B+.) is also observed. The most notable

example of electron-transfer catalysis is the

(or

) reaction of aromatic halides.

The term has its origin in a suggested analogy to acid-base catalysis, with the electron instead of the proton. However, there is a difference between the two catalytic mechanisms, since the electron is not a true catalyst, but rather behaves as the initiator of a chain reaction. 'Electron-transfer induced chain reaction' is a more appropriate term for the situation described by equations (1)­(3).

electronic effect of substituents: symbols and signs

The inductive effect has universally been represented by the symbol . This is now commonly taken

to include both through-bonds and through-space transmission, but is also used specifically for

through-bonds transmission; through-space transmission is then symbolized as (for field effect).

The symbols for the influence of substituents exerted through electron delocalization have variously

been (mesomeric), (electromeric), (tautomeric), (conjugative), K (konjugativ) and

(resonance). Since the present fashion is to use the term resonance effect, is the most commonly

used symbol, although is still seen quite often. Both the possible sign conventions are in use. The

Ingold sign convention associates electronegativity (relative to hydrogen atom) with a negative sign, electropositivity with a positive sign. Thus the nitro group is described as electronwithdrawing by

virtue of its and

effects; chloro is described as a ,

substituent, etc. For correlation

analysis and linear free-energy relationships this convention has been found inconvenient, for it is in contradiction to the sign convention for polar substituent constants (-constants). Authors concerned with these fields often avoid this contradiction by adopting the opposite sign convention originally associated with Robinson, for electronic effects. This practice is almost always associated with the

use of R for the electron delocalization effect: thus the nitro group is a , substituent; chloro

a , substituent, etc.

enantiotopic
Constitutionally identical atoms or groups in molecules which are related by symmetry elements of the second kind only (mirror plane, inversion centre or rotation­reflection axis). For example the two groups c in a grouping Cabcc are enantiotopic. Replacement of one of a pair of enantiotopic groups forms one of a pair of enantiomers. Analogously, if complexation or addition to one of the two faces defined by a double bond or other molecular plane gives rise to a chiral species, the two faces are called enantiotopic.

in catalysis
Enzymes or cells which are of relatively large size may be entrapped in a maze of polymeric molecules (a gel). This procedure is called immobilization by inclusion. When the biocatalyst is enclosed inside a semipermeable membrane, usually approximately spherical, the method is known as encapsulation. In the process of reticulation the primary biocatalyst particles (individual enzyme molecules, cofactors or individual cells) are covalently attached to each other by organic chains, into a three-dimensional network. The term grafting is also used in this context. Attachment to the support by adsorption forces is called immobilization by adsorption.

energy transfer
in photochemistry
From a phenomenological point of view, the term is used to describe the process by which a molecular entity absorbs light and a phenomenon originates from the excited state of another molecular entity. In mechanistic photochemistry the term has been reserved for the photophysical process in which an excited state of one molecular entity (the donor) is deactivated to a lower-lying state by transferring energy to a second molecular entity (the acceptor) which is thereby raised to a higher energy state. The excitation may be electronic, vibrational, rotational or translational. The donor and acceptor may be two parts of the same molecular entity, in which case the process is called intramolecular energy transfer.

enzymes
Macromolecules, mostly of protein nature, that function as (bio)catalysts by increasing the reaction rates. In general, an enzyme catalyses only one reaction type (reaction specificity) and operates on only one type of substrate (substrate specificity). Substrate molecules are attacked at the same site (regiospecificity) and only one or preferentially one of the enantiomers of chiral substrates or of racemic mixtures is attacked (stereospecificity).

The excluded volume of a segment depends on the Gibbs and Helmholtz energies of mixing of solvent and polymer, i.e. on the thermodynamic quality of the solvent, and is not a measure of the geometrical volume of that segment.

exclusion chromatography
Chromatography in which separation is based mainly on exclusion effects, such as differences in molecular size and/or shape or in charge. The term size-exclusion chromatography may also be used when separation is based on molecular size. The terms gel filtration and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) were used earlier to describe this process when the stationary phase is a swollen gel. The term ion-exclusion chromatography is specifically used for the separation of ions in an aqueous phase.

exfoliated graphite
The product of very rapid heating (or flash heating) of graphite intercalation compounds, such as graphite hydrogensulfate of relatively large particle diameter (flakes). The vaporizing intercalated substances force the graphite layers apart. The exfoliated graphite assumes an accordion-like shape with an apparent volume often hundreds of times that of the original graphite flakes. Note: Exfoliated graphite is usually prepared from well-crystallized natural flake graphite. It is used for the production of graphite foils. Exfoliated graphite is different from the deflagration product of graphite oxide (graphitic acid).

expansion factor
in polymers

The ratio of a dimensional characteristic of a macromolecule in a given solvent at a given temperature to the same dimensional characteristic in the state at the same temperature. The most frequently used

expansion factors are: expansion factor of the mean-square end-to-end distance,

;

expansion factor of the radius of gyration

; viscosity expansion factor

where and

are the intrinsic viscosity in a given solvent and in the state at the same

experimental perturbational calculation
To assess the uncertainty of derived final results from a least-squares procedure one can investigate the sensitivity of output data for errors in the input data by means of this calculation. One performs the calculations many times with perturbed input data and studies the relation between the changes (perturbations) in the input data and the changes in the output data. The perturbations are preferably generated using random numbers with a distribution function chosen to mimic the distribution of uncertainties in the primary results.

field desorption
in mass spectrometry
A term used to describe the formation of ions in the gas phase from a material deposited on a solid surface (known as an 'emitter') in the presence of a high electrical field. 'Field desorption' is an ambiguous term because it implies that the electric field desorbs a material as an ion from some kind of emitter on which the material is deposited. There is growing evidence that some of the ions formed are due to thermal ionization and some to field ionization of vapour evaporated from material on the emitter. Because there is generally little or no ionization unless the emitter is heated by an electric current, 'field desorption' is a misnomer. The term is, however, firmly implanted in the literature and most users undertand what is going on regardless of the implications of the term. In addition, no better simple term has been suggested to take its place and so, reluctantly, it is recommended that it be retained.

Some authors distinguish between coagulation and flocculation, the latter implying the formation of a loose or open network which may or may not separate macroscopically. The loose structure formed in this way is called a floc.

flow injection enthalpimetry
Synonym: enthalpimetric flow injection analysis
A term used to describe several related methods in which a transient temperature change in a flowing liquid stream, caused by a chemical reaction, is used to quantitatively determine an analyte. The analyte is introduced as a discrete liquid sample (i.e. test portion) into the flowing stream. This definition limits the scope to experiments with primarily an analytical emphasis, performed in a flow injection calorimeter. This maintains a clear distinction from classical flow calorimetric methods where reagents are combined continuously in flowing streams, or where the heat effect is measured via the flowing of a fluid over a reaction vessel. An acceptable synonym is enthalpimetric flow injection analysis. Other non-recommended terms which have been used in the literature include peak enthalpimetry and enzyme thermistor. Flow enthalpimetry has been used to describe the flow injection technique, but its use for this purpose is discouraged.

Fouling agents (or mechanical inhibitors) are inhibitory substances bound by neither covalent nor other strong bonds to the active centres: the interaction is usually of the van der Waals, H-bond or sometimes ionic, type.

Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer
A high-frequency mass spectrometer in which the cyclotron motion of ions, having different mass/ charge ratios, in a constant magnetic field is excited essentially simultaneously and coherently by a pulse or a radio-frequency electric field applied perpendicular to the magnetic field. The excited cyclotron motion of the ions is subsequently detected on so-called receiver plates as a time domain signal that contains all the cyclotron frequencies that have been excited. Fourier transformation of the time domain signal results in the frequency domain FT-ICR signal which, on the basis of the inverse proportionality between frequency and the mass/charge ratio, can be converted into a mass spectrum.

fragmentation reaction
in mass spectrometry A fragmentation reaction may be written:

The decomposition of a metastable ion of mass-to-charge ratio into an ion of mass-to-charge ratio
after electric acceleration of the metastable ion and before magnetic deflection gives rise to a
peak in the mass spectrum at an apparent mass, . The symbol should be used to indicate the
apparent mass of the product ions giving rise to this peak. Traditionally, the peak itself has been called a metastable peak and this should preferably be expressed as metastable ion peak. It is nevertheless recommended that the former term should be retained. The word metastable should never be used as a noun. Its use as an adjective should be limited to such terms as metastable ion, where it is used correctly, and to the special case of metastable peak discussed above. It should never be used in such terms as metastable reaction, metastable decomposition, metastable studies, etc. It should be clear that the metastable ion is the ion that undergoes fragmentation; it is not detected. When a reaction is written with an asterisk above the arrow as shown:

this means that the reaction has been confirmed by the observation of a metastable peak. The textual

description of such a process may be written as, for example, ( ,

Also contains definitions of: Franck­Condon state, vertical transition
Classically, the Franck­Condon principle is the approximation that an electronic transition is most likely to occur without changes in the positions of the nuclei in the molecular entity and its environment. The resulting state is called a Franck­Condon state, and the transition involved, a vertical transition. The quantum mechanical formulation of this principle is that the intensity of a vibronic transition is proportional to the square of the overlap integral between the vibrational wavefunctions of the two states that are involved in the transition.

The situation best understood is that where a reactant is nonspecifically adsorbed in the outer Helmholtz plane (inner boundary of the diffuse layer). The effect of such adsorption on electrode kinetics is usually termed the Frumkin effect. Rate constants, transfer coefficients etc. corrected for this effect are frequently called 'true' rate constants etc. It would be preferable to describe them as 'corrected for the Frumkin effect', but in any case, if such a correction is carried out, the basis on which it is made should be clearly described.

gas sensing electrode
A sensor composed of an indicator and a reference electrode in contact with a thin film of solution which is separated from the bulk of the sample solution by a gas-permeable membrane or an air gap. This intermediate solution interacts with the gaseous species (penetrated through the membrane or an air gap) in such a way as to produce a change in a measured constituent (e.g. the H+ activity) of the intermediate solution. This change is then sensed by the ion-selective electrode and is related to the partial pressure of the gaseous species in the sample. [Note: In electrochemical literature the term gas electrode is used for the classical, redox-equilibrium-based gas electrodes as well, such as the hydrogen or the chlorine gas electrodes (Pt (s)|H2 (g) | H+ (aq) or Pt (s) |Cl2 (g) | Cl- (aq)]. These electrodes respond both to the partial pressure of the gas (H2 or Cl2 ) and to the ionic activities (H+

gas-filled X-ray detector
A cylindrical cathode with a window, an axial wire anode and an ionizable gas. The gas may be continuously replenished giving a flow-through detector or the detector may be sealed. Following an original ionizing event, electron multiplication occurs through a process of gas amplification in the high electric field surrounding the anode wire. The gain of this process is defined as the number of electrons collected on the anode wire for each primary electron produced. For X-rays having energies higher than the excitation potential of the detector gas, the spectral responsivity function has a second peak in addition to the main peak that is called the escape peak. The escape peak has a mean pulse height proportional to the difference between the photon energy of the incident X-rays and of the spectral characteristic line of the detector gas. A quenching gas, a molecular gas, is added to the detector gas in order to neutralize the detector gas ions and to absorb secondary electrons as well as UV radiation resulting from neutralization of detector gas ions. According to the potential applied to the anode, the detector can work as an ionization chamber, proportional counter, or Geiger counter.

The term 'vapour-grown carbon fibres' alternatively used in the literature is acceptable.

The problem is that the average value of a variable (such as ) that is a function of concentration is not the same as the value of the function at the average concentration. In the case of electrode potentials, the average potential is equivalent to the geometric mean concentration. The correct procedure is to transform to units of concentration before averaging.

Gibbs energy diagram
A diagram showing the relative standard Gibbs energies of reactants, transition states, reaction intermediates and products, in the same sequence as they occur in a chemical reaction. These points are often connected by a smooth curve (a 'Gibbs energy profile', commonly still referred to as a 'free energy profile') but experimental observation can provide information on relative standard Gibbs energies only at the maxima and minima and not at the configurations between them. The abscissa expresses the sequence of reactants, products, reaction intermediates and transition states and is usually undefined or only vaguely defined by the reaction coordinate (extent of bond breaking or bond making). In some adaptations the abscissas are however explicitly defined as bond orders, Brønsted exponents, etc. Contrary to statements in many text books, the highest point on a Gibbs energy diagram does not necessarily correspond to the transition state of the rate-limiting step. For example, in a stepwise reaction consisting of two reaction steps:
one of the transition states of the two reaction steps must (in general) have a higher standard Gibbs energy than the other, whatever the concentration of D in the system. However, the value of that concentration will determine which of the reaction steps is rate-limiting. If the particular concentrations of interest, which may vary, are chosen as the standard state, then the rate-limiting step is the one of highest Gibbs energy.

Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron transfer

For photoinduced electron transfer between an acceptor ( ) and a donor ( ) (either one of them may

be the electronically excited molecular entity) of any charge type,

electrode potential of the acceptor (both relative to the same reference electrode) and

excited state at energy takes part in the reaction), all data referring to the same solvent.

with the standard electrode potential at which the oxidation occurs, and the standard
electrode potential at which the reduction occurs. This form of the first term within the brackets is misleading and not recommended. 3. The standard emfs of oxidation and reduction are often called, respectively, 'oxidation' and 'reduction potential'. These terms are intrinsically confusing and should be avoided altogether, because they conflate the chemical concept of reaction with the physical concept of electrical potential. 4. The equation used for the calculation of the Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron-transfer processes should not be called the Rehm-Weller equation.

Method for kinetic analysis of time-resolved emission or absorption data. Note: Typical for the analysis of emission (or transient absorption) data. Upon excitation with a particular wavelength, radiant intensity of the emission (or transient absorbance difference) decays are observed as a function of a variable parameter, e.g., the observation wavelength, but otherwise under the same condition. All decays are then analysed together (globally) under the constraint that the lifetimes of the transient species do not vary with the variable parameter, e.g., the observation wavelength in the given example.

half life,
For a given reaction the half life of a reactant is the time required for its concentration to reach
a value that is the arithmetic mean of its initial and final (equilibrium) values. For a reactant that is entirely consumed it is the time taken for the reactant concentration to fall to one half its initial value: The half life of a reaction has meaning only in special cases: 1. For a first-order reaction, the half life of the reactant may be called the half life of the reaction. 2. For a reaction involving more than one reactant, with the concentrations of the reactants in their
stoichiometric ratios, the half life of each reactant is the same, and may be called the half life of the reaction. If the concentrations of reactants are not in their stoichiometric ratios, there are different half lives for different reactants, and one cannot speak of the half life of the reaction.

Hammond principle (Hammond postulate)
Also contains definition of: Leffler's assumption
The hypothesis that, when a transition state leading to an unstable reaction intermediate (or product) has nearly the same energy as that intermediate, the two are interconverted with only a small reorganization of molecular structure. Essentially the same idea is sometimes referred to as 'Leffler's assumption', namely, that the transition state bears the greater resemblance to the less stable species (reactant or reaction intermediate/product). Many text books and physical organic chemists, however, express the idea in Leffler's form, but attribute it to Hammond. As a corollary, it follows that a factor stabilizing a reaction intermediate will also stabilize the transition state leading to that intermediate. The acronym 'Bemahapothle' (Bell, Marcus, Hammond, Polanyi, Thornton, Leffler) is sometimes used in recognition of the principal contributors towards expansion of the original idea of the Hammond postulate.

The Haworth representation of the cyclic forms of monosaccharides can be derived from the Fischer projection, as follows. The monosaccharide is depicted with the carbon-chain horizontal and in the plane of the paper, the potential carbonyl group being to the right. The oxygen bridge is then depicted as being formed behind the plane of the paper. The heterocyclic ring is therefore located in a plane approximately perpendicular to the plane of the paper and the groups attached to the carbon atoms of that ring are above and below the ring. The carbon atoms of the ring are not shown. Groups that appear to the right of the vertical chain in the Fischer projection (structures A, D) then appear below the plane of the ring in the Haworth representation (structures B, C, E). However, at the asymmetric carbon atom (C-5 in A; C-4 in D) involved via oxygen in ring formation with the carbon atom of the carbonyl group a formal double inversion must be envisaged to obtain the correct Haworth representation. In the pyranose forms of D-aldohexoses C-6 will always be above the plane, In the furanose forms of D-aldohexoses the position of C-6 will depend on the configuration at C-4; it will, for example, be above the plane in D-glucofuranoses (e.g. C) but below the plane in D-galactofuranoses (e.g. E).

helium dead-space
in colloid and surface chemistry
The position of the Gibbs surface is often defined experimentally as that surface which encloses the volume of space from which the solid excludes helium gas (the so-called helium dead-space), and is associated with the assumptions that the volume of the solid is unaffected by the adsorption of component i, and that helium is not adsorbed by the solid. This requires that the measurement of the helium dead-space be made at a sufficiently high temperature.

helium ionization detector
in gas chromatography

A weak beta source and a high potential raise the helium atom of the carrier gas to a metastable state.

All other substances having an ionization potential lower than

are ionized, and the current that

results is used to measure the components. The detector is usually employed to measure inorganic

compounds at concentrations between and

. It has a linear range of about but is

somewhat unstable and requires great care to ensure the helium purity and to eliminate all leaks in

the system.

homodesmotic reaction
A subclass of isodesmic reactions in which reactants and products contain equal numbers of carbon atoms in corresponding states of hybridization; moreover, there is matching of the carbon-hydrogen bonds in terms of the number of hydrogen atoms joined to the individual carbon atoms. To achieve all this matching, one should significantly extend the number and types of reference molecules. In the aliphatic series of hydrocarbons these are propane, isobutane and neopentanes as well as propene and isobutene; for aromatics--buta-1,3-diene, 2-vinylbutadiene (3-methylidenehexa-1,5-diene) and 2,3divinylbutadiene (3,4-bismethylidenehexa-1,5-diene). Thus to assess strain energy of cyclopropane and aromatic stabilization of benzene the following homodesmotic reactions are to be respectively analysed. c-(CH2)3 + 3 CH3­CH3 3 CH3CH2CH3
() C6H6 + 3 CH2=CH2 3 CH2=CH­CH=CH2(trans)
() Due to closer matching of the hybridization states of the atoms of reactants and products as compared to isodesmic reactions, the homodesmotic reactions give more accurate estimates of the intrinsic strain and the cyclic delocalization. The definition may be extended to molecules with heteroatoms.

homogeneous polymer blend
Also contains definition of: miscible polymer blend
Polymer blend that is a single-phase structure. Notes: 1. Modified from previous definition. The definition proposed here is preferred because it
emphasizes the requirement for homogeneity over miscibility. 2. For a polymer blend to be miscible it must obey the thermodynamic criteria of miscibility. 3. Miscibility is sometimes assigned erroneously on the basis that a blend exhibits a single or
is optically clear. 4. The miscible system can be thermodynamically stable or metastable. 5. For components of chain structures that would be expected to be miscible, miscibility may not
occur if molecular architecture is changed, e.g., by crosslinking.

homolysis (homolytic)
The cleavage of a bond ('homolytic cleavage' or 'homolytic fission') so that each of the molecular fragments between which the bond is broken retains one of the bonding electrons. A unimolecular reaction involving homolysis of a bond (not forming part of a cyclic structure) in a molecular entity containing an even number of (paired) electrons results in the formation of two radicals:

It is the reverse of colligation. Homolysis is also commonly a feature of bimolecular substitution reactions (and of other reactions) involving radicals and molecules. See also: bond-dissociation energy, heterolysis

Common examples are poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(hexamethylene adipamide). 2. Some polymers are obtained by the chemical modification of other polymers such that the structure of the macromolecules that constitute the resulting polymer can be thought of as having

Hückel (4n + 2) rule
Monocyclic planar (or almost planar) systems of trigonally (or sometimes digonally) hybridized atoms that contain (4n + 2) -electrons (where n is a non-negative integer) will exhibit aromatic character. The rule is generally limited to n = 0­5. This rule is derived from the Hückel MO calculation on planar monocyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (CH)m where m is an integer equal to or greater than 3 according to which (4n + 2) -electrons are contained in a closed-shell system. Examples of systems that obey the Hückel rule include:

hula-twist (HT) mechanism
Volume-conserving mechanism of photoisomerization of a double bond in a conjugated system involving simultaneous configurational and conformational isomerization, e.g., the photoinitiated concerted rotation of two adjacent double and single bonds.

Note: Under unconstrained conditions, the conventional one-bond-flip (OBF) process is the dominant process with the hula-twist (HT) being an undetectable higher energy process. It has been proposed that under confined conditions (e.g., a conjugated double bond chromophore in a protein cavity or in a solid matrix), the additional viscosity-dependent barriers makes the OBF a less favourable process, allowing the volume-conserving HT to be the dominant process for photoisomerization.

3. In configurations containing shells less than half full of electrons, the term having the lowest total angular momentum lies lowest in energy, whereas in those with shells more than half
filled, the term having the largest value of lies lowest (fine structure rule). Hund rules apply if the 'Russell­Saunders' coupling scheme is valid. Sometimes the first rule is applied with questionable validity to molecules.

hyperconjugation
Also contains definitions of: heterovalent hyperconjugation, isovalent hyperconjugation, sacrificial hyperconjugation
In the formalism that separates bonds into  and  types, hyperconjugation is the interaction of -bonds (e.g. C­H, C­C, etc.) with a  network. This interaction is customarily illustrated by contributing structures, e.g. for toluene (below), sometimes said to be an example of 'heterovalent' or 'sacrificial hyperconjugation', so named because the contributing structure contains one two-electron bond less than the normal Lewis formula for toluene:

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

701 of 1622

At present, there is no evidence for sacrificial hyperconjugation in neutral hydrocarbons. The concept of hyperconjugation is also applied to carbenium ions and radicals, where the interaction is now between -bonds and an unfilled or partially filled - or p-orbital. A contributing structure illustrating this for the tert-butyl cation is:
This latter example is sometimes called an example of 'isovalent hyper-conjugation' (the contributing structure containing the same number of two-electron bonds as the normal Lewis formula). Both structures shown on the right hand side are also examples of 'double bond-no-bond resonance'. The interaction between filled - or p- orbitals and adjacent antibonding * orbitals is referred to as 'negative hyperconjugation', as for example in the fluoroethyl anion:

hypercoordination
A property of main-group atoms in molecular entities to acquire coordination numbers greater than four (which would comply with the Lewis octet rule). Hypercoordination may be associated with hypervalency, but usually is referred to peculiar atomic centres in the electron-deficient species with multicentre -bonding, in which the bonding power of a pair of electrons is spread over more than two atoms. An example of a hypercoordinated atom is the five-coordinate carbon atom in the methanium cation, where three C­H bonds may be regarded as normal two center - two electron bonds and the bonding in the remaining CH2 fragment is governed by the three-centre, two-electron bond.

Two main contributions to the hyperfine coupling are usually considered, Fermi contact and dipolar interactions. The contact interaction is isotropic and related to the unpaired

spin density at the nucleus,

hypervalency
The ability of an atom in a molecular entity to expand its valence shell beyond the limits of the Lewis octet rule. Hypervalent compounds are common for the second and subsequent row elements in groups 15­18 of the periodic table. A description of the hypervalent bonding implies a transfer of the electrons from the central (hypervalent) atom to the nonbonding molecular orbitals which it forms with (usually more electronegative) ligands. A typical example of the hypervalent bond is a linear three-centre, four-electron bond, e.g. that of Fap­P­Fap fragment of PF5.

inductive effect
In strict definition, an experimentally observable effect (on rates of reaction, etc.) of the transmission of charge through a chain of atoms by electrostatic induction. A theoretical distinction may be made between the field effect, and the inductive effect as models for the Coulomb interaction between a given site within a molecular entity and a remote unipole or dipole within the same entity. The experimental distinction between the two effects has proved difficult, except for molecules of peculiar geometry, which may exhibit 'reversed field effects'. Ordinarily the inductive effect and the field effect are influenced in the same direction by structural changes in the molecule and the distinction between them is not clear. This situation has led many authors to include the field effect in the term 'inductive effect'. Thus the separation of values into inductive and resonance components does not imply the exclusive operation of a through-bonds route for the transmission of the non-conjugative part of the substituent effect. To indicate the all-inclusive use of the term inductive, the phrase 'socalled inductive effect' is sometimes used. Certain modern theoretical approaches suggest that the 'socalled inductive effect' reflects a field effect rather than through-bonds transmission. See also: mesomeric effect, polar effect

The interfacial concentration (or simply ) of a species B is the concentration of that species at
the boundary of the electrical double-layer facing the solution, i.e. just outside the region where the departures from the electroneutrality of the solution are significant.

interfacial double-layer
Also contains definitions of: electrical double-layer, surface charge layer, transition layer
The Coulombic interaction of interfacial charges (e.g. ions) and the magnetic or electrostatic interaction of interfacial molecules lead to particularly complex interfacial structures. Complex interfacial profiles that can be approximated by two distinct sub-layers with different physical properties (e.g. structure and/or nature and/or composition), are referred to as interfacial doublelayers. Examples of such approximated complex profiles are: the electrical double-layer consisting of a surface charge layer (i.e. a two dimensional distribution of one type of ions) and a diffuse charge layer (counter-ions distributed over the space region next to the surface); the approximated profile of the orientation angle of anisotropic liquid molecules within a 'double-layer' consisting of a distribution of so-called anchored molecules which are perturbed (strongly bound and orientated) by the surface, and the adjacent, so-called, transition layer, i.e. the region where the surface perturbation is damped.

interfacial layer
The inhomogeneous space region intermediate between two bulk phases in contact, and where properties are significantly different from, but related to, the properties of the bulk phases. Examples of such properties are: compositions, molecular density, orientation or conformation, charge density, pressure tensor, electron density, etc. The interfacial properties vary in the direction normal to the surface. Complex profiles of interfacial properties occur in the case of multicomponent systems with coexisting bulk phases where attractive/repulsive molecular interactions involve adsorption or depletion of one or several components. This interfacial region may also be regarded as a distinct, though not autonomous, phase and be called the interphase.

interfering substance
in electroanalytical chemistry
Any substance, other than the ion being measured, whose presence in the sample solution affects the measured emf of a cell. Interfering substances fall into two classes: 'electrode/electrochemical' interferences and 'chemical' interferences. Examples of the first class include: 1. Those substances which give a similar response to the ion being measured and whose presence
generally results in an apparent increase in the activity (or concentration) of the ion to be determined (e.g. Na+ for the Ca2+ electrode). 2. Electrolytes present at a high concentration that give rise to appreciable liquid junction potential differences or results in a significant activity coefficient decrease, or incipient Donnan exclusion failure. The second class of substances that should be recognized as chemical interferences includes: 3. Species that interact with the ion being measured so as to decrease its activity or apparent concentration. The electrode continues to report the true activity (e.g. CN- present in the measurement of Ag+), but a considerable gap will occur between the activity and concentration of the ions even in very dilute solutions. Under these circumstances the determination of ionic concentration may be problematic. 4. Substances interacting with the membrane itself, blocking the surface or changing its chemical composition [i.e. organic solvents for the liquid or poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane electrodes] are grouped as interferences or electrode poisons.

intrinsically conducting polymer
Electrically conducting polymer composed of macromolecules having fully conjugated sequences of double bonds along the chains. Notes: 1. The bulk electrical conductivity of an intrinsically conducting polymer is comparable to that of
some metals and results from its macromolecules acquiring positive or negative charges through oxidation or reduction by an electron-acceptor or -donor (charge-transfer agent), termed a dopant. 2. Examples of intrinsically conducting polymers are polyacetylene, polythiophene, polypyrrole, or polyaniline. Unlike polymeric electrolytes, in which charge is transported by dissolved ions, charge in intrinsically conducting polymers is transported along and between polymer molecules via generated charge carriers (e.g., holes, electrons). 3.

ion pair
Also contains definitions of: contact ion pair, intimate ion pair, loose ion pair, solventseparated ion pair, solvent-shared ion pair, tight ion pair
A pair of oppositely charged ions held together by Coulomb attraction without formation of a covalent bond. Experimentally, an ion pair behaves as one unit in determining conductivity, kinetic behaviour, osmotic properties, etc. Following Bjerrum, oppositely charged ions with their centres closer together than a distance:

are considered to constitute an ion pair ('Bjerrum ion pair'). [ and are the charge numbers of
the ions, and is the relative permittivity (or dielectric constant) of the medium.] An ion pair, the
constituent ions of which are in direct contact (and not separated by an intervening solvent or other neutral molecule) is designated as a 'tight ion pair' (or 'intimate' or 'contact ion pair'). A tight ion pair of X+ and Y- is symbolically represented as X+Y-. By contrast, an ion pair whose constituent ions are separated by one or several solvent or other neutral molecules is described as a 'loose ion pair', symbolically represented as X+ || Y-. The members of a loose ion pair can readily interchange with other free or loosely paired ions in the solution. This interchange may be detectable (e.g. by isotopic labelling) and thus afford an experimental distinction between tight and loose ion pairs. A further conceptual distinction has sometimes been made between two types of loose ion pairs. In 'solventshared ion pairs' the ionic constituents of the pair are separated by only a single solvent molecule, whereas in 'solvent-separated ion pairs' more than one solvent molecule intervenes. However, the term 'solvent-separated ion pair' must be used and interpreted with care since it has also widely been used as a less specific term for 'loose' ion pair.

ion pair return
Also contains definitions of: external ion-pair return, hidden return, internal return
The recombination of a pair of ions R+ and Z- formed from ionization of RZ. If the ions are paired as a tight ion pair and recombine without prior separation into a loose ion pair this is called 'internal ion-pair return':
It is a special case of 'primary geminate recombination'. If the ions are paired as a loose ion pair and form the covalent chemical species via a tight ion pair, this is called 'external ion-pair return':

ion-selective electrode (ISE)
An electrochemical sensor, based on thin films or selective membranes as recognition elements, and an electrochemical half-cell equivalent to other half-cells of the zeroth (inert metal in a redox electrolyte), 1st, 2nd and 3rd kinds. These devices are distinct from systems that involve redox reactions (electrodes of zeroth, 1st, 2nd and 3rd kinds), although they often contain a 2nd kind electrode as the 'inner' or 'internal' reference electrode. The potential difference response has, as its principal component, the Gibbs energy change associated with permselective mass transfer (by ion-exchange, solvent extraction or some other mechanism) across a phase boundary. The ion-selective electrode must be used in conjunction with a reference electrode (i.e. 'outer' or 'external' reference electrode) to form a complete electrochemical cell. The measured potential differences (ion-selective electrode vs. outer reference electrode potentials) are linearly dependent on the logarithm of the activity of a given ion in solution. Comment: The term 'ion-specific electrode' is not recommended. The term 'specific' implies that the electrode does not respond to additional ions. Since no electrode is truly specific for one ion, the term 'ion-selective' is recommended as more appropriate. 'Selective ion-sensitive electrode' is a little-used term to describe an ion-selective electrode. 'Principal' or 'primary' ions are those which an electrode is designed to measure. It is never certain that the 'principal' ion is most sensitively measured, e.g. nitrate ion-selective electrodes.

The bond between atoms with sharply different electronegativities. In strict terms, an ionic bond refers to the electrostatic attraction experienced between the electric charges of a cation and an anion, in contrast with a purely covalent bond. In practice, it is preferable to consider the amount of ionic character of a bond rather than referring to purely ionic or purely covalent bonds. The relationship was proposed (L. Pauling) for the estimation of ionic character of a bond between atoms A and B:

in polymers
In the crystalline state, polymer chains are generally parallel to one another but neighbouring chains of equivalent conformation may differ in chirality and/or orientation. Chains of identical chirality and conformation are isomorphous. Chains of opposite chirality but equivalent conformation are enantiomorphous. For example, two ...TG+TG+TG+... helices of isotactic poly(propylene) are isomorphous. Isotactic poly(propylene) chains of the ...TG+TG+TG+... and ...G-TG-TG-T... types are mutually enantiomorphous. With regard to orientation, consider a repeating side group originating

isopotential point
For an ion-selective electrode cell, there is often a particular activity of the measured ion for which the emf of the cell is independent of temperature. That activity, and the corresponding potential difference, defines the isopotential point. The specification of the ion-selective electrode and outer reference electrode must be described. Comment: When an isothermal cell is used with identical reference electrodes, the isopotential point is the activity of sensed species that gives zero net membrane potential, e.g. sensed activity is the same in the inner and outer (test) solution. Calibration lines for different cell temperatures have different slopes, but intersect at a common activity point. Cells with temperature gradients are not recommended.

isosbestic point

Wavelength, wavenumber or frequency at which the total absorbance of a sample does not change during a chemical reaction or a physical change of the sample. Notes: 1. A simple example occurs when one molecular entity is converted into another that has the same
molar absorption coefficient at a given wavelength. As long as the sum of the concentrations of the two molecular entities in the solution is held constant there will be no change in absorbance at this wavelength as the ratio of the concentrations of the two entities is varied. 2. The name derives from the Greek words: isos: equal, the same, and sbestos: extinguishable. 3. Contrary to a widely accepted idea, the existence of an isosbestic point does not prove that the reaction is a quantitative conversion of one species into a unique other species or that an equilibrium exists between only two species. The observation of isosbestic points only indicates that the stoichiometry of the reaction remains unchanged during the chemical reaction or the physical change of the sample, and that no secondary reactions occur during the considered time

range, since

is invariant ( is the absorbance at wavelength , is the

optical path, is the molar decadic absorption coefficient of the species of concentration ).
For the reaction A + B  c C + d D + e E, with c, d, and e the percentages of the products C, D, and E, an isosbestic point will be observed at every wavelength where the condition
, provided that the values of the percentages c, d, and e remain
constant during the chemical reaction or the physical change. The use of the obsolete term isoabsorption point is not recommended.

Jablonski diagram
Originally, a diagram showing that the fluorescent state of a molecular entity is the lowest excited state from which the transition to the ground state is allowed, whereas the phosphorescent state is a metastable state below the fluorescent state, which is reached by radiationless transition.

Presently, modified Jablonski diagrams are frequently used and are actually state diagrams in which molecular electronic states, represented by horizontal lines displaced vertically to indicate relative energies, are grouped according to multiplicity into horizontally displaced columns. Excitation and relaxation processes that interconvert states are indicated in the diagram by arrows. Radiative transitions are generally indicated with straight arrows (), while radiationless transitions are generally indicated with wavy arrows .

Jahn­Teller effect
Molecular distortions due to an electronically degenerate ground state. For non-linear molecular entities in a geometry described by a point symmetry group possessing degenerate irreducible representations there always exists at least one non-totally symmetric vibration that makes electronically degenerate states unstable at this geometry. The nuclei are displaced to new equilibrium positions of lower symmetry causing a splitting of the originally degenerate states (first-order Jahn­ Teller effect). Note: Effect due to the odd terms in the vibronic perturbation expansion. In the case of molecules with a non-degenerate ground electronic state but with a low-lying degenerate excited state, distortions of proper symmetry arise that result in mixing of the ground and excited states, thereby lowering the ground-state energy (pseudo Jahn­Teller effect). The pseudo Jahn­Teller effect manifests itself in fluxional behaviour (see fluxional molecules) and stereochemical non-rigidity of molecules and ions. The Jahn­Teller effect generates a surface crossing (e.g., a conical intersection) whereas a pseudo Jahn­Teller effect generates an avoided crossing. See also: Renner­Teller effect

kinetic electrolyte effect (kinetic ionic-strength effect)
Also contains definitions of: primary kinetic electrolyte effect, secondary kinetic electrolyte effect
The general effect of an added electrolyte (i.e. an effect other than, or in addition to, that due to its possible involvement as a reactant or catalyst) on the observed rate constant of a reaction in solution. At low concentrations (when only long-range coulombic forces need to be considered) the effect on a given reaction is determined only by the ionic strength of the solution and not by the chemical identity of the ions. For practical purposes, this concentration range is roughly the same as the region of validity of the Debye­Hückel limiting law for activity coefficients. At higher concentrations, the effect of an added electrolyte depends also on the chemical identity of the ions. Such specific action can usually be interpreted as the incursion of a reaction path involving an ion of the electrolyte as reactant or catalyst, in which case the action is not properly to be regarded just as a kinetic electrolyte effect. Kinetic electrolyte effects are usually (too restrictively and therefore incorrectly) referred to as 'kinetic salt effects'. A kinetic electrolyte effect ascribable solely to the influence of the ionic strength on activity coefficients of ionic reactants and transition states is called a 'primary kinetic electrolyte effect'. A kinetic electrolyte effect arising from the influence of the ionic strength of the solution upon the pre-equilibrium concentration of an ionic species that is involved in a subsequent rate-limiting step of a reaction is called a 'secondary kinetic electrolyte effect'. A common case encountered in practice is the effect on the concentration of hydrogen ion (acting as catalyst) produced from the ionization of a weak acid in a buffer solution. Synonymous with kinetic equivalence. See also: common-ion effect, order of reaction, kinetic ambiguity

kinetic equivalence
Two reaction schemes are kinetically equivalent if they imply the same rate law. For example, consider the two schemes (i) and (ii) for the formation of C from A:
Providing that B does not accumulate as a reaction intermediate.

Providing that B does not accumulate as a reaction intermediate:

Both equations for are of the form:

where and are constants (sometimes called 'coefficients in the rate equation'). The equations are
identical in their dependence on concentrations and do not distinguish whether OH- catalyses the formation of B, and necessarily also its reversion to A, or is involved in its further transformation to C. The two schemes are therefore kinetically equivalent under conditions to which the stated provisos apply.

kinetic isotope effect
The effect of isotopic substitution on a rate constant is referred to as a kinetic isotope effect. For example, in the reaction:

and with neglect of isotopic mass on tunnelling and the transmission coefficient, can be regarded as if it were the equilibrium constant for an isotope exchange reaction between the transition state [TS] and the isotopically substituted reactant A, and calculated from their vibrational frequencies as in the case of a thermodynamic isotope effect. Isotope effects like the above, involving a direct or indirect comparison of the rates of reaction of isotopologues, are called 'intermolecular', in contrast to intramolecular isotope effects, in which a single substrate reacts to produce a non-statistical distribution of isotopomeric product molecules.

For signals originating in a greater depth of the sample (back scattered electrons, X-rays) the lateral resolution is worse than the corresponding value of the beam diameter due to the diffusion of the primary electrons. The lateral resolution may be determined exactly with a sandwich specimen or a sharp edge specimen, or approximately with a specimen showing a regular microstructure of known dimensions.

The statement that those elementary reactions are the most favoured which exhibit the fewest possible alterations in the positions of the atomic nuclei and in the electronic configuration. The most frequently used mathematical formulation of the principle rests on a mechanical model of a molecule in which the energy of structural deformation, when reactants (r) turn into products (p), is assumed to be proportional to the sum of the squares of the changes in the positions of the nuclei common to both reactants and products

where is the force constant (in many applications set equal to unity).

ligands
1. In an inorganic coordination entity, the atoms or groups joined to the central atom.
Source: Red Book, p. 146 2. In biochemistry: if it is possible or convenient to regard part of a polyatomic molecular entity as central, then the atoms, groups or molecules bound to that part are called ligands. Biochemical usage is thus wider, in that the central entity can be polyatomic. Thus H+ may be a ligand for proteins and for citrate as well as for O2- . It may even be a ligand for a univalent entity such as acetate: in other circumstances, AcO- may be the ligand for H+, since the definition makes it clear that the view of which entity is central may change for convenience. Thus, four calcium ions are ligands for calmodulin, when the protein is regarded as central: four carboxylate groups of calmodulin ligate (are ligands of) each calcium ion when this ion is regarded as central. It is the ligand that is said to ligate the central entity, which is said to be ligated. When the hormone binding to a receptor is called a ligand, the receptor is thus regarded as the central entity. Biochemists should bear in mind that the usage in inorganic chemistry has been that ligands bind only single atoms, so they should be cautious in fields such as bioinorganic chemistry where confusion may be possible.

If it moves along a circle the beam is circularly polarized and if it moves along an ellipse the beam is elliptically polarized. Note: Circular polarization is said to be right-handed if the direction of rotation is clockwise when viewed against the direction of propagation and left-handed if the sense of the rotation is opposite. When the position of the endpoint of the electric vector is viewed at a given time t as a function of distance along x, it forms a left-handed helix if the light polarization is left-handed and a right-handed helix is it is right-handed.

local flame temperature,
in flame emission and absorption spectrometry
The effective thermodynamic temperature in the observation space as measured by a specific sensor for a specified element (in ). The temperature of a flame (or other plasma) is not homogeneous. It is usually lower at the borders of the flame. It is therefore appropriate to speak of an effective temperature which represents an average value of all temperatures throughout the observation space. The flame temperature depends on several factors such as: kind of plasma, kind of gas or gas mixture and concentration gradient of the thermometric species in the observation space.

local fraction atomized, ,
in flame emission and absorption spectrometry
The substance fraction of the atomized component in the total volatilized component. This quantity is measured in a defined part of the flame, usually the observation space. The fraction atomized is the result of chemical reactions in the gaseous state. It depends on the bond strength of the compounds that the component may form within the flame and on the composition and temperature of the flame. When analysing elements that tend to become oxidized in the flame, it may be advisable to use as fuel gas mixtures with a reducing component such as C2H2 or N2O .

local fraction desolvated, ,
in flame emission and absorption spectrometry
The amount-of-substance fraction of component in a desolvated state in the amount of component entering the flame. This quantity is measured in a defined part of the flame, usually the observation space. Because it varies with height in the flame as a result of progressive evaporation of aerosol droplets, it is appropriate to term the expression local. The fraction desolvated does not account for losses by incomplete volatilization of the dry aerosol (which largely depends upon the nature and concentration of the component). Such losses are described by local fraction volatilized, which usually depends on the solute. Since varies markedly with the height in the flame, its observed value represents an average. Local fraction desolvated depends on the solvent, the temperature of the flame and the time the component takes to travel from the tip of the burner to the height in the flame considered.

Upon excitation of an 'isotropic' sample (assuming an ultra short excitation pulse) the relationship between the fluorescence intensity detected at a time and through a polarization analyser oriented at an angle with respect to the electric polarization of the exciting beam is given by

Notes: 1. This concept also applies for time-resolved absorption measurements in cases in which

magnetic circular dichroism
Acronym: MCD
Magnetic circular dichroism is observed when a sample differentially absorbs left- and rightcircularly polarized light in a magnetic field parallel to the light beam. Notes: 1. The MCD signal, , is calculated as

with and the absorption coefficients for right and left circularly polarized light,
respectively. The spectra are a representation of vs wavelength. Often, is recorded as a
function of the applied field (up to ) and the temperature. 2. Phenomenon related to 'magnetically induced optical activity (Faraday effect)' by the 'Kramers-
Kronig transformations', which connect optical refraction and absorption, i.e., MCD is observed in optically active materials at wavelengths with non-vanishing absorption. It occurs for diamagnetic, paramagnetic and (anti)-ferromagnetic material and has been observed from IR (infrared) to X-ray regions. MCD optical transitions in molecular species arise if (i) degenerate electronic states are split in the presence of a magnetic field (first-order-Zeeman effect) or (ii) states are mixed together by the applied magnetic field (second-order-Zeeman effect). This may occur in the initial or the final states. 3. MCD is used as a probe of paramagnetism that permits the identification of the electronic and magnetic properties of the ground states of transition metal ion centres. The wavelength dependence of MCD can be used also to identify and assign optical transitions from metal ion sites. 4. Technique complementary to both EPR and electronic absorption spectroscopies in facilitating assignment of the ground-state spin and electronic transitions of a molecular entity.

magnetic transition
A transition between disordered and ordered arrays of atomic magnetic moments. Where the ordered phase has a net spontaneous magnetization, , the magnetic-ordering temperature is called a
Curie temperature, ; where the net spontaneous magnetization of the ordered phase remains
zero, the ordering temperature is called a Néel temperature, . The temperature at which the two
ferromagnetic subarrays of a ferrimagnet just cancel each other is called the compensation point. Materials exhibit ferromagnetic behaviour when unpaired electron spins are aligned in parallel, antiferromagnetic behaviour when the alignment is antiparallel, and ferrimagnetic behaviour if the alignment of the spins is antiparallel with unequal numbers in the two orientations or if the spins are canted. Therefore, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and weak ferromagnetic transitions involve a net magnetic moment change, whereas antiferromagnetic transitions have zero net magnetic moment change. Note: Antiferromagnetic order below may be complex; for example, canting of spins as in GdFeO3 ,
spiral-spin configuration as may occur in MnO2 , and amplitude modulation, as in some rare-earth metals.

'In the addition of hydrogen halides to unsymmetrically constituted [unsaturated] hydrocarbons, the halogen atom becomes attached to the carbon bearing the lesser number of hydrogen atoms.'

'In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.' This is an indirect statement of the common mechanistic observation, that the more electropositive (electrophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the end of the multiple bond that would result in the more stable carbenium ion (whether or not a carbenium

decreasing order.

2. If

Comment: The use of the median when reporting results of chemical analysis is generally not

recommended, because its statistical efficiency is less than that of the mean. In certain cases, however,

especially when treating small sets of data, the median may offer advantages because it is a so-called

'robust statistic', i.e. it offers considerable resistance to the effects of isolated outliers.

This latter case is the most general form of an ion-selective electrode. The membrane separates the internal components of the ion-selective electrode from the test solution. The membrane of an ion-selective electrode is responsible for the EMF response and selectivity of the entire electrode. Comment: Membranes of sensor electrodes are thought to be practically homogeneous, but an actual membrane may contain inhomogeneous regions, often at surfaces, and connected with materials and preparation methods used. Inhomogeneous regions include low dielectric polymer regions with few charge sites and regions with high local site densities. Surface regions of plasticized liquid membranes often are low in sites and high in plasticizer or exuded impurities.

membrane sites
in an ion-selective electrode
Membranes frequently contain built-in 'fixed' charged sites (e.g. immobile ­(SO3-) in polystyrenesulfonate), or intentionally added, hydrophobically trapped, 'mobile' sites [e.g. tetraphenylborate in plasticized poly(vinyl chloride)]. Such membranes with charged sites are named sited membranes. Ions of opposite sign in the membrane are ' counter-ions '. Ions of the same sign as sites are not present in significant quantities, and are co-ions. Sited membranes are 'permselective' to counter-ions i.e. only counter-ions exchange into the membrane and therefore have some mobility in the membrane bulk.

mercury flow system

in spectrochemical analysis
For mercury released directly as atomic vapour, different direct transfer systems are used. In an open dynamic system the liberated analyte is transported by a carrier gas through the sampling or excitation source and swept away. In an open static system the equilibrated gaseous phase is forced into the absorption cell by displacement, e.g. by water. During measurement the gaseous phase is thus static. In a closed system the analyte and carrier gas are circulated through the absorption cell and the generator vessel until equilibrium between the liquid and gaseous phases is established.

mesomeric effect
Also contains definition of: resonance effect
The effect (on reaction rates, ionization equilibria, etc.) attributed to a substituent due to overlap of its p- or -orbitals with the p- or -orbitals of the rest of the molecular entity.

Strictly understood, the mesomeric effect operates in the ground electronic state of the molecule. When the molecule undergoes electronic excitation or its energy is increased on the way to the transition state of a chemical reaction, the mesomeric effect may be enhanced by the electromeric effect, but this term is not much used, and the mesomeric and electromeric effects tend to be subsumed in the term resonance effect of a substituent.

Michaelis­Menten mechanism
The Michaelis­Menten mechanism is the simplest mechanism that will explain Michaelis­Menten kinetics According to the mechanism, a substrate A first combines with a molecule of enzyme E, and this process is followed by a step in which the enzyme-substrate complex EA breaks down (sometimes with the participation of the solvent) into enzyme and reaction products:

If, as is usual, the substrate A is present in great excess of the enzyme it can be shown that steadystate conditions apply, and that the rate equation is:

equation. Other, more complicated, mechanisms lead to the Michaelis­Menten equation, adherence to which therefore does not require that the Michaelis­ Menten mechanism applies.

the evaluation of the adsorption isotherms and on the model used for the shape of the micropores

(cylindrical, slit-shaped or other).

(hypothetically) a bimolecular reaction in a homogeneous medium occurred instantaneously when two reactant molecular entities made an encounter, the rate of reaction would be an encounter-controlled rate, determined solely by rates of diffusion of reactants. Such a hypothetical 'fully diffusion controlled rate' is also said to correspond to 'total microscopic diffusion control', and represents the asymptotic limit of the rate of reaction as the rate constant for the chemical conversion of the encounter pair into product (or products) becomes large relative to the rate constant for separation (or dissociation) of the encounter pair. 'Partial microscopic diffusion control' is said to operate in a homogeneous reaction when the rates of chemical conversion and of separation are comparable.

The sign convention regarding current is such that the migration current is negative for the reduction of a cation or for the oxidation of an anion, and positive for the oxidation of a cation or the reduction of an anion. Hence the migration current may tend to either increase or decrease the total current observed. In any event the migration current approaches zero as the transport number of the electroactive substance is decreased by increasing the concentration of the supporting electrolyte, and hence the conductivity

where

is the Gibbs energy of mixing and the composition, where is usually taken

as the volume fraction of one of the components. The system is unstable if the above second derivative is negative. The borderline (spinodal) between metastable and unstable states is defined by the above second derivative equalling zero. If the compositions of two conjugate (coexisting) phases become identical upon a change of temperature or pressure, the third derivative also equals zero (defining a critical state). 4. If a mixture is thermodynamically metastable, it will demix if suitably nucleated. If a mixture is thermodynamically unstable, it will demix by spinodal decomposition or by nucleation and growth if suitably nucleated, provided there is minimal kinetic hindrance.

Möbius aromaticity

A monocyclic array of orbitals in which there is a single out-of-phase overlap (or, more generally,

an odd number of out-of-phase overlaps) reveals the opposite pattern of aromatic character to

Hückel systems; with electrons it is stabilized (aromatic), whereas with

it is destabilized

(antiaromatic). In the excited state

Möbius -electron systems are stabilized, and systems

are destabilized. No examples of ground-state Möbius -electron systems are known, but the concept has been applied to transition states of pericyclic reactions [See: aromatic]. The name is derived from the topological analogy of such an arrangement of orbitals to a Möbius strip.

In the absence of chain entanglements, loose ends can never be elastically active network chains. 3. In addition to loose ends, model networks usually contain ring structures as network imperfections. 4. Loose ends and ring structures reduce the concentration of elastically active network chains and result in the shear modulus and Young´ s modulus of the rubbery networks being less than the values expected for a perfect network structure. 5. Physical entanglements between network chains can lead to an increase in the concentration of elastically active network chains and, hence, increases in the shear modulus and the Young´ s modulus above the values expected for a perfect network structure.

those orientation properties of the sample that are relevant for light absorption. With the principal

coordinate system ( , , ), forming angles

with the light electric vector in the

direction, all orientation effects induced by light absorption are contained in

sum of for three perpendicular molecular axes is equal to , only two independent parameters

The principal (molecular) coordinate system ( , , ) forming angles

with the light

electric vector should be chosen such that the matrix and the tensor are diagonal.

To describe processes involving two or more photons, such as luminescence of a uniaxial, aligned sample, an expansion of the directional cosines to the fourth power is required. 3. Order parameters (related to Wigner matrices) are an alternative to the directional cosine-based description of molecular alignment. Order-parameter methods also work well for non-uniaxial samples and provide a seemingly more complex, but in other ways convenient, description of molecular orientation distributions. Wigner matrices are used as a basis set for an expansion of the orientation­distribution function.

molecular rearrangement
Also contains definition of: principle of minimum structural change
The term is traditionally applied to any reaction that involves a change of connectivity (sometimes including hydrogen), and violates the so-called 'principle of minimum structural change'. According to this oversimplified principle, chemical species do not isomerize in the course of a transformation, e.g. substitution, or the change of a functional group of a chemical species into a different functional group is not expected to involve the making or breaking of more than the minimum number of bonds required to effect that transformation. For example, any new substituents are expected to enter the precise positions previously occupied by displaced groups. The simplest type of rearrangement is an intramolecular reaction in which the product is isomeric with the reactant (one type of 'intramolecular isomerization'). An example is the first step of the Claisen rearrangement:

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

954 of 1622

The definition of molecular rearrangement includes changes in which there is a migration of an atom or bond (unexpected on the basis of the principle of minimum structural change), as in the reaction:
where the rearrangement stage can formally be represented as the '1,2-shift' of hydride between adjacent carbon atoms in the carbocation:
Such migrations occur also in radicals, e.g.:

The definition also includes reactions in which an entering group takes up a different position from the leaving group, with accompanying bond migration. An example of the latter type is the 'allylic rearrangement':

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

955 of 1622

A distinction is made between 'intramolecular rearrangements' (or 'true molecular rearrangements') and ' intermolecular rearrangements' (or 'apparent rearrangements'). In the former case the atoms and groups that are common to a reactant and a product never separate into independent fragments during the rearrangement stage (i.e. the change is intramolecular), whereas in an 'intermolecular rearrangement' a migrating group is completely free from the parent molecule and is re-attached to a different position in a subsequent step, as in the Orton reaction:

Process by which phase domains increase in size during the aging of a multiphase material. Notes: 1. In the coarsening at the late stage of phase separation, volumes and compositions of phase
domains are conserved. 2. Representative mechanisms for coarsening at the late stage of phase separation are: (1) material
flow in domains driven by interfacial tension (observed in a co-continuous morphology), (2) the growth of domain size by evaporation from smaller droplets and condensation into larger droplets, and (3) coalescence (fusion) of more than two droplets. The mechanisms are usually called (1) Siggia s mechanism, (2) Ostwald ripening (or the Lifshitz­Slyozov mechanism), and (3) coalescence. 3. Morphology coarsening can be substantially stopped by, for example, vitrification, crosslinking, and pinning, the slowing down of molecular diffusion across domain interfaces.

natural atomic orbital (NAO)

A valence-shell atomic orbital whose derivation involves diagonalising the localized block of the

full density matrix of a given molecule associated with basis functions

on that atom. A

distinguishing feature of NAOs is that they meet the simultaneous requirement of orthonormality and maximum occupancy. For isolated atoms, NAOs coincide with natural orbitals. In a polyatomic molecule the NAOs (in contrast to natural orbitals that become delocalised over all nuclear centres) mostly retain one-centre character, and thus are optimal for describing the molecular electron density around each atomic centre.

natural graphite
A mineral found in nature. It consists of graphitic carbon regardless of its crystalline perfection. Note: Some natural graphites, often in the form of large flakes, show very high crystalline perfection. Occasionally, they occur as single crystals of graphite. The use of the term natural graphite as a synonym for the term 'graphite single crystal' is incorrect and should be avoided. Varieties of natural graphite with lower structural perfection are classified as 'microcrystalline natural graphite'. Commercial natural graphite is often contaminated with other minerals, e.g. silicates, and may contain rhombohedral graphite due to intensive milling.

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

where the coefficients are a set of numbers which form the density matrix. The NOs reduce the density matrix to a diagonal form:

where the coefficients are occupation numbers of each orbital. The importance of natural orbitals
is in the fact that CI expansions based on these orbitals have generally the fastest convergence. If a CI calculation was carried out in terms of an arbitrary basis set and the subsequent diagonalisation of the density matrix gave the natural orbitals, the same calculation repeated in terms of the natural
orbitals thus obtained would lead to the wave-function for which only those configurations built up from natural orbitals with large occupation numbers were important.

The commonly used term for a special type of coke with extremely high graphitizability resulting from a strong preferred parallel orientation of its turbostratic layer structure and a particular physical shape of the grains. Note: Needle coke is derived mainly from clean (i.e. lacking hetero atoms and solids) and highly aromatic (i.e. several condensed rings per cluster) feedstocks with a very low concentration of insolubles. Upon solidification a material with a distinctive streaked or flow-like macroscopic appearance is produced. Upon grinding the coke breaks up first into macroscopic needles and then, after further grinding, into microplatelets. Sometimes the word 'acicular' is used as a synonym for needle-like.

neighbouring group participation
Also contains definitions of: anchimeric assistance, synartetic acceleration
The direct interaction of the reaction centre (usually, but not necessarily, an incipient carbenium centre) with a lone pair of electrons of an atom or with the electrons of a - or -bond contained within the parent molecule but not conjugated with the reaction centre. A distinction is sometimes made between n-, - and -participation. A rate increase due to neighbouring group participation is known as 'anchimeric assistance'. 'Synartetic acceleration' is the special case of anchimeric assistance ascribed to participation by electrons binding a substituent to a carbon atom in a -position relative to the leaving group attached to the -carbon atom. According to the underlying model, these electrons then provide a three-centre bond (or 'bridge') 'fastening together' (as the word 'synartetic' is intended to suggest) the - and -carbon atoms between which the charge is divided in the intermediate bridged ion formed (and in the transition state preceding its formation). The term synartetic acceleration is not widely used. See also: intramolecular catalysis, multi-centre bond

These techniques differ in the nature of the pulse sequence, the geometry and the choice of a spatial direction (phase matching), as well as the mode of detection. 2. Low order non-linear techniques, such as three-wave mixing, are related to the second order polarization. For a random isotropic medium with inversion symmetry, the secondorder polarization vanishes and then the lowest order optical non-linear techniques, as well as the higher order non-linear techniques are related to the third-order polarization and the corresponding 'hyper-susceptibility'.

nucleophile (nucleophilic)
A nucleophile (or nucleophilic reagent) is a reagent that forms a bond to its reaction partner (the electrophile) by donating both bonding electrons. A 'nucleophilic substitution reaction' is a heterolytic reaction in which the reagent supplying the entering group acts as a nucleophile. For example:
The term 'nucleophilic' is also used to designate the apparent polar character of certain radicals, as inferred from their higher relative reactivity with reaction sites of lower electron density. Nucleophilic reagents are Lewis bases.

1. The device is a powerful solid-state source of broadly tunable coherent radiation. It consists of a crystal, usually BBO (BaB2O4), located inside an optical resonator and pumped by a very intense laser beam (typically provided by a pulsed neodymium laser or a diode laser). The pump beam
(wavelength frequency ) is partially converted into two coherent beams, the signal and the

idler, with wavelengths ( , ) and frequencies ( , ) such that

. By simultaneous

rotation of the crystal and adjustment of the optical resonator, the wavelength of the signal beam

is continuously tunable, theoretically from to

and practically over a slightly more

reduced range. 2. For example, for

(3rd harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser), can be tuned from

3. This 'splitting of one photon into two photons' is the reverse of the 'sum frequency mixing' used, for instance, to generate the 3rd harmonic of a laser emission by mixing in a convenient crystal the fundamental and the frequency doubled beams (a way to get the 3rd harmonic much more efficiently than by pure frequency tripling as described under harmonic frequency generation).

orbital symmetry
The behaviour of an atomic or localized molecular orbital under molecular symmetry operations characterizes its orbital symmetry. For example, under a reflection in an appropriate symmetry plane, the phase of the orbital may be unchanged (symmetric), or it may change sign (antisymmetric), i.e. the positive and negative lobes are interchanged. A principal context for the use of orbital symmetry is the discussion of chemical changes that involve 'conservation of orbital symmetry'. If a certain symmetry element (e.g. the reflection plane) is retained along a reaction pathway, that pathway is 'allowed' by orbital symmetry conservation if each of the occupied orbitals of the reactant(s) is of the same symmetry type as a similarly (e.g. singly or doubly) occupied orbital of the product(s). This principle permits the qualitative construction of correlation diagrams to show how molecular orbitals transform (and how their energies change) during idealized chemical changes (e.g. cycloadditions ). An idealized single bond is a -bond, i.e. it has cylindrical symmetry, whereas a p-orbital or -bond orbital has -symmetry, i.e. it is antisymmetric with respect to reflection in a plane passing through the atomic centres with which it is associated. In ethene, the -bonding orbital is symmetric with respect to reflection in a plane perpendicular to and bisecting the C­C bond, whereas the *-antibonding orbital is antisymmetric with respect to this operation. Considerations of orbital symmetry are frequently grossly simplified in that, for example, the p-orbitals of a carbonyl group would be treated as having the same symmetry as those of ethene, and the fact that the carbonyl group in, for example, camphor, unlike that in formaldehyde, has no mirror planes would be ignored. These simplified considerations nevertheless afford the basis of one approach to the understanding of the rules which indicate whether pericyclic reactions are likely to occur under thermal or photochemical conditions.

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

1035 of 1622

The exponents , , ... can be positive or negative integral or rational nonintegral numbers. They are the reaction orders with respect to A, B, ... and are sometimes called 'partial orders of reaction'. Orders of reaction deduced from the dependence of initial rates of reaction on concentration are called 'orders of reaction with respect to concentration'; orders of reaction deduced from the dependence of the rate of reaction on time of reaction are called 'orders of reaction with respect to time'. The concept of order of reaction is also applicable to chemical rate processes occurring in systems for which concentration changes (and hence the rate of reaction) are not themselves measurable, provided it is possible to measure a chemical flux. For example, if there is a dynamic equilibrium according to the equation:
and if a chemical flux is experimentally found, (e.g. by NMR line-shape analysis) to be related to concentrations by the equation:

then the corresponding reaction is of order with respect to A ... and of total (or overall) order
. The proportionality factor above is called the ( th order) 'rate coefficient'. Rate
coefficients referring to (or believed to refer to) elementary reactions are called 'rate constants' or, more appropriately 'microscopic' (hypothetical, mechanistic) rate constants. The (overall) order of a reaction cannot be deduced from measurements of a 'rate of appearance' or 'rate of disappearance' at a single value of the concentration of a species whose concentration is constant (or effectively constant) during the course of the reaction. If the overall rate of reaction is, for example, given by:

but [B] stays constant, then the order of the reaction (with respect to time), as observed from the
concentration change of A with time, will be , and the rate of disappearance of A can be expressed in the form:

The proportionality factor

deduced from such an experiment is called the 'observed rate

coefficient' and it is related to the

th order rate coefficient by the equation:

For the common case when

, is often referred to as a 'pseudo-first order rate

coefficient' ( ). For a simple (elementary) reactions a partial order of reaction is the same as the
stoichiometric number of the reactant concerned and must therefore be a positive integer (see rate of reaction ). The overall order is then the same as the molecularity . For stepwise reactions there is no general connection between stoichiometric numbers and partial orders. Such reactions may have more complex rate laws, so that an apparent order of reaction may vary with the concentrations of the chemical species involved and with the progress of the reaction: in such cases it is not useful to speak of orders of reaction, although apparent orders of reaction may be deducible from initial rates. In a stepwise reaction, orders of reaction may in principle always be assigned to the elementary steps.

A very qualitative term which includes any and all trace gases which have a greater oxidation potential than oxygen (for example, ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, NO3, etc.). It is recommended that alternative, more definitive terms be used which define the specific oxidant of interest whenever possible.

oxidation
1. The complete, net removal of one or more electrons from a molecular entity (also called 'deelectronation').
2. An increase in the oxidation number of any atom within any substrate. 3. Gain of oxygen and/or loss of hydrogen of an organic substrate. All oxidations meet criteria 1 and 2, and many meet criterion 3, but this is not always easy to demonstrate. Alternatively, an oxidation can be described as a transformation of an organic substrate that can be rationally dissected into steps or primitive changes. The latter consist in removal of one or several electrons from the substrate followed or preceded by gain or loss of water and/or hydrons

or hydroxide ions, or by nucleophilic substitution by water or its reverse and/or by an intramolecular molecular rearrangement. This formal definition allows the original idea of oxidation (combination with oxygen), together with its extension to removal of hydrogen, as well as processes closely akin to this type of transformation (and generally regarded in current usage of the term in organic chemistry to be oxidations and to be effected by 'oxidizing agents') to be descriptively related to definition 1. For example the oxidation of methane to chloromethane may be considered as follows:

oxidation number
Of a central atom in a coordination entity, the charge it would bear if all the ligands were removed along with the electron pairs that were shared with the central atom. It is represented by a Roman numeral. Note: The term Stock number is no longer recommended.

oxidation state
A measure of the degree of oxidation of an atom in a substance. It is defined as the charge an atom might be imagined to have when electrons are counted according to an agreed-upon set of rules: (l) the oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is zero; (2) for a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion; (3) hydrogen has an oxidation state of 1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of -2 when they are present in most compounds. (Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an oxidation state of -1 in hydrides of active metals, e.g. LiH, and oxygen has an oxidation state of -1 in peroxides, e.g. H2O2; (4) the algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion. For example, the oxidation states of sulfur in H2S, S8 (elementary sulfur), SO2, SO3, and H2SO4 are, respectively: -2, 0, +4, +6 and +6. The higher the oxidation state of a given atom, the greater is its degree of oxidation; the lower the oxidation state, the greater is its degree of reduction.

oxidized species
A term used to characterize the degree of oxidation (or reduction) in atoms, molecules and ions. It can be applied to an atom in a molecule or an ion which has a high oxidation state. An element or atom in a compound can be oxidized by reaction with oxygen, while it can be reduced by reaction with hydrogen. An oxidized species may be formed also through the loss of electrons (either to the positive electrode in a cell, or through transfer to another atom or group of atoms). For example, the sulfur in H2S is reduced sulfur relative to elementary sulfur, while SO2 and SO3 are oxidized. Metallic iron (Fe) is a reduced state of iron, while the Fe2+ ion (ferrous ion) and Fe3+ ion (ferric ion) are oxidized states of iron. Fe3+ is in a higher oxidation state than Fe2+ which is in a higher oxidation state than Fe. See: oxidation state

peak current
In linear-sweep voltammetry, triangular-wave voltammetry, cyclic triangular-wave voltammetry, and similar techniques, the maximum value of the faradaic current due to the reduction or oxidation of a substance B during a single sweep. This maximum value is attained after an interval during which the concentration of B at the electrode-solution interface decreases monotonically, while the faradaic current due to the reduction or oxidation of B increases monotonically, with time. It is attained before an interval during which this current decreases monotonically with time because the rate of transport of B toward the electrode-solution interface is smaller than the rate at which it is removed from the interface by electrolysis. The term has also been used to denote the maximum value of the faradaic current attributable to the reduction or oxidation of an electroactive substance in techniques such as ac polarography, differential pulse polarography, and derivative polarography. However, these techniques give curves that arise in ways different from that cited above, and the terms summit, summit current, and summit potential are therefore recommended for use in connection with such techniques.

peak elution volume (time), ,
in column chromatography
The volume of mobile phase entering the column between the start of the elution and the emergence of the peak maximum, or the corresponding time. In most of the cases, this is equal to the total retention volume (time). There are, however, cases when the elution process does not start immediately at sample introduction. For example, in liquid chromatography, sometimes the column is washed with a liquid after the application of the sample to displace certain components which are of no interest and during this treatment the sample does not move along the column. In gas chromatography, there are also cases when a liquid sample is applied to the top of the column but its elution starts only after a given period. This term is useful in such cases.

Peak widths represent retention dimensions (time or volume) parallel to the baseline. If the baseline is not parallel to the axis representing time or volume, then the peak widths are to be drawn parallel to this axis. Three peak-width values are commonly used in chromatography. Peak width at base ( ) is the segment of the peak base intercepted by the tangents drawn to the inflection points on either side of the peak. Peak width at half height ( ) is the length of the line parallel to the peak base at 50% of the peak height that terminates at the intersection with the two limbs of the peak. Peak width

Peierls distortion
Distortion of a regular one-dimensional structure with a partially occupied band to give bond alternation, eventually leading to dimerization or oligomerization. The degree of oligomerization, depends on the electronic population of the conduction band indicated by the wave vector of the Fermi level
Note: A Peierls distortion opens a gap at the Fermi level, producing a net stabilization of the distorted structure. The Peierls distortion for chain compounds is analogous to the Jahn­Teller effect for molecules. The prototypical example of the Peierls distortion in organic chemistry is the bond alternation present in polyvinylene.

perturbation theory

Along with variational method, the second major quantum-mechanical approximation method. The methods of perturbation theory are based on representation of the Hamiltonian of a system under

study, , through the Hamiltonian, , of a system, whose Schroedinger equation is solvable,

and its relatively small perturbation :

. Numerous techniques are derived allowing

one to relate the unknown eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the perturbed system to the known

eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the unperturbed system. As distinct from the variational method,

the methods of perturbation theory are applicable to all the electronic states of an atom or molecule.

When is time-dependent, the perturbed system does not have stationary states. In this case time-
dependent perturbation theory, which is the method of approximate calculation of the expansion of wave-functions of the perturbed system over wave-functions of stationary states of the unperturbed system, must be employed. The applications of this method are associated mostly with studies of light emission and absorption by atoms and molecules.

petroleum coke
A carbonization product of high-boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained in petroleum processing (heavy residues). It is the general term for all special petroleum coke products such as green, calcined and needle petroleum coke. Note: High-boiling hydrocarbon fractions (heavy residues) used as feedstock for petroleum coke are residues from distillation (atmospheric pressure, vacuum) or cracking (e.g. thermal, catalytic, steam-based) processes. The nature of feedstock has a decisive influence on the graphitizability of the calcined coke.

pH
The quantity pH is defined in terms of the activity of hydrogen(1+) ions (hydrogen ions) in solution:

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

where

is the activity of hydrogen ion (hydrogen 1+) in aqueous solution,

,

is the activity coefficient of

(molality basis) at molality

, and

is

the standard molality.

Notes:

1. pH cannot be measured independently because calculation of the activity involves the activity

coefficient of a single ion. Thus it can be regarded only as a notional definition.

2. The establishment of primary pH standards requires the application of the concept of 'primary

method of measurement', assuring full traceability of the results of all measurements and their

uncertainties. Any limitation in the theory of determination of experimental variables must be

included in the estimated uncertainty of the method.

3. The primary method for measurement of pH involves the use of a cell without transference,

known as the Harned cell:

Pt(s) | H2(g) | Buffer S, Cl-(aq) | AgCl(s) | Ag(s)

The equation for this cell can be rearranged to give:

where is the potential difference of the cell and is the known standard potential of the

AgCl | Ag electrode. Measurements of as a function of

(called the acidity function) is found by extrapolation to

theory. Then

in

and

in pH. Materials for primary standard buffers must also meet the appropriate requirements

for reference materials, including chemical purity and stability, and applicability of the Bates­

Guggenheim convention for the estimation of

This convention requires that the

ionic strength be

. Primary standard buffers should also lead to small liquid

junction potentials when used in cells with liquid junctions. Secondary standards,

, are

also available, but carry a greater uncertainty in measured values.

4. Practical pH measurements generally use cells with liquid junctions in which, consequently,

liquid junction potentials, , are present. Measurements of pH are not normally performed using

the Pt|H2 electrode, but rather the glass (or other H+ - selective) electrode, whose response factor
( ) usually deviates from the Nernst slope. The associated uncertainties are significantly
larger than those associated with fundamental measurements using the Harned cell. Nonetheless, incorporation of the uncertainties for the primary method, and for all subsequent measurements, permits the uncertainties for all procedures to be linked to the primary standards by an unbroken chain of comparisons. 5. Reference values for standards in D2O and aqueous-organic solvent mixtures exist.

photodiode
Also contains definitions of: avalanche photodiode, PIN (p-intrinsic-n) diode, Schottkybarrier photodiode
A two-electrode, radiation-sensitive junction formed in a semiconductive material. A junction is formed by two successive regions of a semiconductive material having, respectively, an excess of electrons (n-type) or holes (p-type). A bias potential applied to the detector creates a region at the interface that is depleted of majority carriers. Each incident photon produces electron-hole pairs in the depletion region resulting in a measurable signal current. The photodiode can be operated either with zero bias in the photovoltaic mode where the photodiode is actually generating the electric potential supplied to the load. In a biased mode, the photoconductive mode, the reverse current is proportional to the irradiation. A Schottky-barrier photodiode is constructed by deposition of a metal film on a semiconductor surface in such a way that no interface layer is present. The barrier thickness depends on the impurity dopant concentration in the semiconductor layer. The incident radiation generates electon-hole pairs within the depletion region of the barrier where they are collected efficiently and rapidly by the built-in field. A PIN (p-intrinsic-n) diode is a planar diffused diode consisting of a single crystal having an intrinsic (undoped or compensated) region sandwiched between p- and n-type regions. A bias potential applied across the detector depletes the intrinsic region of charge carriers, constituting the radiation-sensitive detector volume. The number of electron-hole pairs produced is dependent on the energy of the incident photons. An avalanche photodiode is a photodiode in which the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are accelerated by a bias potential near to breakdown potential so that further electron-hole pairs are formed leading to saturation of the photocurrent. This operational mode for photon counting is the so-called Geiger mode, similar to that of the gas filled Geiger counter. Avalanche photodiodes can also be operated in the proportional mode.

mixtures (photostationary states) rich in thermodynamically unstable isomers. 3. Photoisomerization is the primary photochemical reaction of the chromophore in several
biological photoreceptors such as retinal proteins (e.g., rhodopsin), phytochromes, and the photoactive yellow protein.

photometry

The measurement of light over wavelengths which produce visual sensation (approximately -

by a standard source (formerly a 'standard international candle', now a blackbody radiator emitting at

the temperature of solidifying platinum,

). Luminance and illuminance are the photometric

analogues of the radiometric quantities radiance and irradiance, respectively, but conversion from

photomultiplier tube
Also contains definitions of: channel photomultiplier tube, strip dynode photomultiplier tube
A vacuum phototube with additional amplification by electron multiplication. It consists of a photocathode, a series of dynodes, called a dynode chain on which a secondary-electron multiplication process occurs, and an anode. According to the desired response time, transit time, time spread, gain, or low dark current, different types of dynode structures have been developed, e.g. circular cage structure, linear focused structure, venetian blind structure, box and grid structure. Some special dynode structures permit combination with additional electric or magnetic fields. A strip dynode photomultiplier tube consists of a photocathode followed by thin dynode material on an insulating substrate. In a continuous-strip photomultiplier, two strip dynodes are arranged in parallel. A potential applied to the ends of the two strips produces an electric field across the continuous strip dynodes, giving rise to electron multiplication along the dynodes. In a resistance-strip magnetic photomultiplier, a uniform magnetic field is applied to the planes of the strips, so that the electrons travel in the crossed electric and magnetic fields. A channel photomultiplier tube photocathode consists of a channel electron multiplier (CEM) system for the photoelectrons, and an anode to collect the final electron current. The basic part of the CEM is a tube with a semiconducting inner surface. In general it is curved in order to inhibit the acceleration of positive ions towards the photocathode. A number of small channels called microchannels can be constructed in arrays for imaging applications.

Recording of sequential single photons counted by way of recording and counting sequential electron pulses at the anode of the photomultiplier. Notes: 1. Each electron pulse consists of 105­106 electrons resulting from the multiplication, in the
'dynode' arrangement (or the microchannel plate) of a photomultiplier, of a single photoelectron emitted by a photosensitive layer (the photocathode of the photomultiplier) upon arrival of a single photon. 2.

photon echo
Time-resolved optical spectroscopy in which the inhomogeneous broadening of absorbers is eliminated by the proper choice of geometry in a four-wave mixing experiment. Notes: 1. Term applied to a group of non-linear optical techniques such as integrated echo, time-gated
echo, three-pulse echo peak shift, heterodyne-detected echo and 2D-echo. 2. Photon echo techniques make use of the third-order optical polarization and 'hyper-
susceptibility'. The main distinguishing feature of photon echo methods from all other third-order processes is the time ordering of the field interactions that leads to a rephasing process in the induced polarization to remove inhomogeneous contributions to the absorption linewidth. 3. In terms of mathematical description, the photon echo is equal to the spin echo (solid-state physics) from which a term 'echo' was borrowed. 4. Technique used, e.g., to probe solvation dynamics upon (ultra-short) pulse excitation of a chromophore.

from the melt, pitches solidify without crystallization.

Note:

The ratio of aromatic to aliphatic hydrogen depends mainly on the source of the starting material.

The hydrogen aromaticity (ratio of aromatic to total hydrogen atoms) varies between 0.3 and 0.9.

The aliphatic hydrogen in pitch is largely associated with alkyl side chains substituted on aromatic

rings. The content of heterocyclic compounds in pitches varies depending on their origins. Also, the

softening temperature can vary in a broad range between about and

depending on the

molecular weight (relative molecular mass) and composition of the constituents.

pitch-based carbon fibres
Carbon fibres obtained from pitch precursor fibres after stabilization treatment, carbonization and final heat treatment. Note: The term pitch-based carbon fibres comprises the isotropic pitch-based carbon fibres as well as the anisotropic mesophase pitch-based carbon fibres (MPP-based carbon fibres). The isotropic type belongs to the carbon fibres type LM (low modulus) and is mainly used as filler in polymers and insulation materials and for similar applications. The anisotropic type (MPP-based carbon fibres) belongs to the carbon fibres type HM and is used mainly for reinforcement purposes due to its high Young's modulus value.

polar effect

For a reactant molecule RY, the polar effect of the group R comprises all the processes whereby

a substituent may modify the electrostatic forces operating at the reaction centre Y, relative to the

standard

. These forces may be governed by charge separations arising from differences in

the electronegativity of atoms (leading to the presence of dipoles), the presence of unipoles, or

electron delocalization. It is synonymous with electronic effect or 'electrical effect' of a substituent

as distinguished from other substituent effects, e.g. steric effects. Sometimes, however, the term

'polar effect' is taken to refer to the influence, other than steric, that non-conjugated substituents exert

on reaction rates, i.e. effects connected with electron delocalization between a substituent and the

molecular framework to which it is attached are excluded. Polar effect is then not synonymous with

electronic effect

Occasionally, the term solvent polarity is restricted to nonspecific solute/solvent interactions only (i.e. to van der Waals forces).

average over three rectilinear axes of the molecule. Polarizabilities in different directions (e.g. along

the bond in Cl2 , called 'longitudinal polarizability', and in the direction perpendicular to the bond,

called 'transverse polarizability') can be distinguished, at least in principle. Polarizability along the

bond joining a substituent to the rest of the molecule is seen in certain modern theoretical approaches

as a factor influencing chemical reactivity, etc., and parametrization thereof has been proposed.

Notes: 1. In most cases (e.g., in vinyl polymers, polyamides) degradation is accompanied by a decrease in
molar mass. In some cases (e.g., in polymers with aromatic rings in the main chain), degradation means changes in chemical structure. It can also be accompanied by crosslinking. 2. Usually, degradation results in the loss of, or deterioration in, useful properties of the material. However, in the case of biodegradation (degradation by biological activity), polymers may change into environmentally acceptable substances with desirable properties.

A curve describing the variation of the potential energy of the system of atoms that make up the reactants and products of a reaction as a function of one geometric coordinate, and corresponding to the 'energetically easiest passage' from reactants to products (i.e. along the line produced by joining the paths of steepest descent from the transition state to the reactants and to the products). For an elementary reaction the relevant geometric coordinate is the reaction coordinate ; for a stepwise reaction it is the succession of reaction coordinates for the successive individual reaction steps. (The reaction coordinate is sometimes approximated by a quasi-chemical index of reaction progress, such as 'degree of atom transfer' or bond order of some specified bond.)

potential-energy (reaction) surface
A geometric hypersurface on which the potential energy of a set of reactants is plotted as a function of the coordinates representing the molecular geometries of the system. For simple systems two such coordinates (characterizing two variables that change during the progress from reactants to products) can be selected, and the potential energy plotted as a contour map. For simple elementary reactions,
e.g. , the surface can show the potential energy for all values of the A, B,
C geometry, providing that the ABC angle is fixed. For more complicated reactions a different choice of two coordinates is sometimes preferred, e.g. the bond orders of two different bonds. Such a diagram is often arranged so that reactants are located at the bottom left corner and products at the top right. If the trace of the representative point characterizing the route from reactants to products follows two adjacent edges of the diagram, the changes represented by the two coordinates take place in distinct succession; if the trace leaves the edges and crosses the interior of the diagram, the two changes are concerted. In many qualitative applications it is convenient (although not strictly equivalent) for the third coordinate to represent the standard Gibbs energy rather than potential energy. Using bond orders is, however, an oversimplification, since these are not well-defined, even for the transition state. (Some reservations concerning the diagrammatic use of Gibbs energies are noted under Gibbs energy diagram). The energetically easiest route from reactants to products on the potential-energy contour map defines the potential-energy profile.

prochirality
Also contains definition of: proprochirality
This term is used in different, sometimes contradictory ways; four are listed below. 1. The geometric property of an achiral object (or spatial arrangement of points or atoms) which
is capable of becoming chiral in a single desymmetrization step. An achiral molecular entity, or a part of it considered on its own, is thus called prochiral if it can be made chiral by the replacement of an existing atom (or achiral group) by a different one. An achiral object which is capable of becoming chiral in two desymmetrization steps is sometimes described as proprochiral. For example the proprochiral CH3CO2H becomes prochiral as CH2DCO2H and chiral as CHDTCO2H . 2. The term prochirality also applies to an achiral molecule or entity which contains a trigonal system and which can be made chiral by the addition to the trigonal system of a new atom or achiral group. For example addition of hydrogen to one of the enantiotopic faces of the prochiral ketone CH3CH2COCH3 gives one of the enantiomers of the chiral alcohol CH3CH2CHOHCH3; the addition of CN- to one of the diastereotopic faces of the chiral aldehyde shown below converts it into one of the diastereoisomers of the cyanohydrin. The two faces of the trigonal system may be described as Re and Si.

3. The term prochiral also applies to a tetrahedral atom of an achiral or chiral molecule which is bonded to two stereoheterotopic groups. For example, the prochiral molecule CH3CH2OH can
be converted into the chiral molecule CH3CHDOH by the isotopic replacement of one of the two
enantiotopic hydrogen atoms of the methylene group. The carbon atom of the methylene group is called prochiral. The prochiral molecule HO2CCH2CHOHCH2CO2H can be converted into a

IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology

chiral product by esterification of one of the two enantiotopic ­CH2CO2H groups. The carbon atom of the CHOH group is called prochiral. The chiral molecule CH3CHOHCH2CH3 can be converted into one of the diastereoisomers of CH3CHOHCHDCH3 by the isotopic replacement of one of the two diastereotopic hydrogen atoms of the methylene group. The carbon atom of the methylene group is called prochiral. The stereoheterotopic groups in these cases may be described as pro-R or pro-S. Reference to the two stereoheterotopic groups themselves as prochiral, although common, is strongly discouraged. See: chirality centre 4. The term prochirality is also applied to the enantiotopic faces of a trigonal system.

pseudo-catalysis
If an acid or base is present in nearly constant concentration throughout a reaction in solution (owing to buffering or the use of a large excess), it may be found to increase the rate of that reaction and also to be consumed during the process. The acid or base is then not a catalyst and the phenomenon cannot be called catalysis according to the well-established meaning of these terms in chemical kinetics, although the mechanism of such a process is often intimately related to that of a catalysed reaction. It is recommended that the term pseudo-catalysis be used in these and analogous cases (not necessarily involving acids or bases). For example, if a Brønsted acid accelerates the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, this is properly called acid catalysis, whereas the acceleration, by the same acid, of hydrolysis of an amide should be described as pseudo-catalysis by the acid: the 'acid pseudo-catalyst' is consumed during the reaction through formation of an ammonium ion. The terms 'general acid pseudo-catalysis' and 'general base pseudo-catalysis' may be used as the analogues of general acid catalysis and general base catalysis. The term 'base-promoted', 'base-accelerated' or 'base-induced' is sometimes used for reactions that are pseudo-catalysed by bases. However, the term 'promotion' also has a different meaning in other chemical contexts.

pseudopericyclic
A concerted transformation is pseudopericyclic if the primary changes in bonding occur within a cyclic array of atoms at one (or more) of which nonbonding and bonding atomic orbitals interchange roles. A formal example is the enol enol prototropy of pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone).
Because the - and -atomic orbitals that interchange roles are orthogonal, such a reaction does not proceed through a fully conjugated transition state and is thus not a pericyclic reaction and therefore not governed by the rules that express orbital symmetry restrictions applicable to pericyclic reactions.

Stereoisomerization resulting in a structure that appears to have been produced by rotation of the entire initial molecule and is superposable on the initial one, unless different positions are distinguished by substitution, including isotopic substitution. One example of pseudorotation is a facile interconversion between the many envelope and twist conformers of a cyclopentane due to the out of plane motion of carbon atoms. Another example of pseudorotation (Berry pseudorotation) is a polytopal rearrangement that provides an intramolecular mechanism for the isomerization of trigonal bipyramidal compounds (e.g. -phosphanes), the five bonds to the central atom E being represented as , , , and . Two equatorial bonds move apart and become apical bonds at the same time as the apical bonds move together to become equatorial.

pulse reactor
in catalysis
In a pulse reactor, a carrier gas, which may be inert or possibly one of the reactants, flows over the catalyst and small amounts of the other reactant or reactants are injected into the carrier gas at intervals. A pulse reactor is useful for exploratory work but kinetic results apply to a transient rather than to the steady state conditions of the catalyst.

pump-probe technique
Transient absorption spectroscopy using two pulses (strong pump and weak probe) and capable of achieving a high temporal resolution. A pump pulse excites the sample and triggers the process under investigation. A second delayed pulse, the probe, monitors an optical property. By varying the time delay between the pump and probe pulses, it is possible to assemble measurements as a function of time. The probe pulse is typically a UV, visible or infrared pulse in which case a snap-shot spectrum is taken as a function of the delay time. Often the probe pulse is generated from a portion of the excitation beam, but it can also be an independently generated electromagnetic pulse. Note: In the case of an optical probe, this interaction is formally a non-linear optical process that is third-order in polarization. The excitation intensity to create the excited state constitutes a two-field interaction and the determination of the change in the time-dependent optical properties involves a third field monitoring the induced time-dependent changes in the 'linear susceptibility'. Diffractive probes (e.g., electrons and X-rays) can also be used, in which case one measures a diffraction pattern as a function of time.

-correlation. Reactions with a positive -value are accelerated (or the equilibrium constants of analogous equilibria are increased) by substituents with positive -constants. Since the sign of was defined so that substituents with a positive increase the acidity of benzoic acid, such substituents are generally described as attracting electrons away from the aromatic ring. It follows that reactions with a positive -value are considered to involve a transition state (or reaction product) so that the difference in energy between this state and the reactants is decreased by a reduction in electron density at the reactive site of the substrate.

radiation detector
Also contains definitions of: energy dispersive detector, nonselective detector, nonselective quantum counter, photochemical detector, photoelectric detector, selective detector, thermal detector
A device in which incident radiation produces a measurable effect. If this effect is a rise in temperature it is called a thermal detector. If it is a rise in pressure it is called a photoacoustic detector. In the case where an electrical signal is produced it is called a photoelectric detector. Photoelectric detectors can be classified as photo-emissive detectors and semiconductor detectors. Where the radiation produces a chemical reaction, it is termed a photochemical detector. A detector yielding an output signal that is independent of the wavelength of the radiation over a specific region is called a nonselective detector. Where it is wavelength specific it is a selective detector. A detector having a quantum efficiency independent of the wavelength is a nonselective quantum counter. Certain detectors are able to distinguish between different quantum energies. This property is described by the energy resolution
and the energy resolving power . These detectors are called energy dispersive detectors. In X-
ray spectroscopy, the reciprocal is often used but this is discouraged.

radical (free radical)
A molecular entity such as .CH3 , .SnH3 , Cl. possessing an unpaired electron. (In these formulae the dot, symbolizing the unpaired electron, should be placed so as to indicate the atom of highest spin density, if this is possible.) Paramagnetic metal ions are not normally regarded as radicals. However, in the 'isolobal analogy' the similarity between certain paramagnetic metal ions and radicals becomes apparent. At least in the context of physical organic chemistry, it seems desirable to cease using the adjective 'free' in the general name of this type of chemical species and molecular entity, so that the term 'free radical' may in future be restricted to those radicals which do not form parts of radical pairs. Depending upon the core atom that possesses the unpaired electron, the radicals can be described as carbon-, oxygen-, nitrogen-, metal-centred radicals. If the unpaired electron occupies an orbital having considerable s or more or less pure p character, the respective radicals are termed - or -radicals. In the past, the term 'radical' was used to designate a substituent group bound to a molecular entity, as opposed to 'free radical', which nowadays is simply called radical. The bound entities may be called groups or substituents, but should no longer be called radicals. See also: biradical

radical ion
Also contains definitions of: anion radical, cation radical, radical anion, radical cation
A radical that carries an electric charge. A positively charged radical is called a 'radical cation' (e.g. the benzene radical cation C6H6.+ ); a negatively charged radical is called a 'radical anion' (e.g. the benzene radical anion C6H6.- or the benzophenone radical anion Ph2C­O.- ). Commonly, but not necessarily, the odd electron and the charge are associated with the same atom. Unless the positions of unpaired spin and charge can be associated with specific atoms, superscript dot and charge designations should be placed in the order .+ or .- suggested by the name 'radical ion'. (e.g. C3H6.+ ). Note: In the previous edition of this Compendium, it was recommended to place the charge designation directly above the centrally placed dot. However, this format is now discouraged because of the difficulty of extending it to ions bearing more than one charge, and/or more than one unpaired electron. In mass spectroscopic usage the symbol for the charge precedes the dot representing the unpaired electron.

The term is used to identify two radicals in close proximity in solution, within a solvent cage. They may be formed simultaneously by some unimolecular process, e.g. peroxide decomposition, or they may have come together by diffusion.

rate of reaction,
Also contains definition of: rate of appearance
For the general chemical reaction :
occurring under constant-volume conditions, without an appreciable build-up of reaction intermediates, the rate of reaction is defined as:

where symbols placed inside square brackets denote amount (or amount of substance) concentrations

(conventionally expressed in units of

). The symbols and are also commonly used in

place of . It is recommended that the unit of time should always be the second. In such a case the

rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor

(the reciprocal of its coefficient in the stoichiometric equation, ) and from the rate of decrease of

concentration of the reactant A by . The quantity:

defined by the equation:

(where designates the amount of substance A, conventionally expressed in units of mole) may be

called the 'rate of conversion' and is appropriate when the use of concentrations is inconvenient, e.g. under conditions of varying volume. In a system of constant volume, the rate of reaction is equal to the rate of conversion per unit volume throughout the reaction. For a stepwise reaction this definition of
'rate of reaction' (and 'extent of reaction', ) will apply only if there is no accumulation of intermediate
or formation of side products. It is therefore recommended that the term 'rate of reaction' be used only in cases where it is experimentally established that these conditions apply. More generally, it is

recommended that, instead, the terms 'rate of disappearance' or 'rate of consumption' of A (i.e.

,

the rate of decrease of concentration of A) or 'rate of appearance' of P (i.e. , the rate of increase of
concentration of product P) be used, depending on the concentration change of the particular chemical species that is actually observed. In some cases reference to the chemical flux observed may be more appropriate. The symbol (without lettered subscript) should be used only for rate of reaction; with a lettered subscript (e.g. ) refers to a rate of appearance or rate of disappearance (e.g. of the
chemical species A). See also: chemical relaxation, lifetime, order of reaction

rate-controlling step
A rate-controlling (rate-determining or rate-limiting) step in a reaction occurring by a composite reaction sequence is an elementary reaction the rate constant for which exerts a strong effect -- stronger than that of any other rate constant -- on the overall rate. It is recommended that the expressions rate-controlling, rate-determining and rate-limiting be regarded as synonymous, but some special meanings sometimes given to the last two expressions are considered under a separate heading. A rate-controlling step can be formally defined on the basis of a control function (or control factor) CF, identified for an elementary reaction having a rate constant by:

where is the overall rate of reaction. In performing the partial differentiation all equilibrium constants and all rate constants except are held constant. The elementary reaction having the largest control factor exerts the strongest influence on the rate , and a step having a CF much larger than any other step may be said to be rate-controlling. A rate-controlling step defined in the way recommended here has the advantage that it is directly related to the interpretation of kinetic isotope effects. As formulated this implies that all rate constants are of the same dimensionality. Consider however the reaction of A and B to give an intermediate C, which then reacts further with D to give products:

rate-determining step (rate-limiting step)
These terms are best regarded as synonymous with rate-controlling step. However, other meanings that have been given to them should be mentioned, as it is necessary to be aware of them in order to avoid confusion. Sometimes the term rate-determining is used as a special case of rate-controlling, being assigned only to an initial slow step which is followed by rapid steps. Such a step imposes an upper limit on the rate, and has also been called rate-limiting. In view of the considerable danger of confusion when special meanings are applied to rate-determining and rate-limiting, it is recommended that they be regarded as synonymous, with the meaning explained under the entry rate-controlling step.

A geometric parameter that changes during the conversion of one (or more) reactant molecular entities into one (or more) product molecular entities and whose value can be taken for a measure of the progress of an elementary reaction (for example, a bond length or bond angle or a combination of bond lengths and/or bond angles; it is sometimes approximated by a non-geometric parameter, such as the bond order of some specified bond). In the formalism of ' transition-state theory ', the reaction coordinate is that coordinate in a set of curvilinear coordinates obtained from the conventional ones for the reactants which, for each reaction step, leads smoothly from the configuration of the reactants through that of the transition state to the configuration of the products. The reaction coordinate is typically chosen to follow the path along the gradient (path of shallowest ascent/deepest descent) of potential energy from reactants to products. The term has also been used interchangeably with the term transition coordinate, applicable to the coordinate in the immediate vicinity of the potential energy maximum. Being more specific, the name transition coordinate is to be preferred in that context. See also: potential-energy profile, potential-energy reaction surface, minimum-energy reaction path

may be described as anti-RSP. There are many examples in which the RSP is followed, but there

are also many examples corresponding to situations (i) and (iii). The RSP is in accord with intuitive

feeling and certainly holds in the limiting case when reactivity is controlled by diffusion. However,

the validity of the RSP is a matter of great controversy.

regioselectivity (regioselective)
A regioselective reaction is one in which one direction of bond making or breaking occurs preferentially over all other possible directions. Reactions are termed completely (100%) regioselective if the discrimination is complete, or partially (x%), if the product of reaction at one site predominates over the product of reaction at other sites. The discrimination may also semiquantitatively be referred to as high or low regioselectivity. (Originally the term was restricted to addition reactions of unsymmetrical reagents to unsymmetrical alkenes.) In the past, the term 'regiospecificity' was proposed for 100% regioselectivity. This terminology is not recommended owing to inconsistency with the terms stereoselectivity and stereospecificity. See also: chemoselectivity

residence time
1. (instrumentation): The time required for air or reagent parcel to pass from the entrance to the exit of an instrument. Often this is approximated as the ratio of the interior volume of the device to the flow rate.
2. (atmospheric): The average time a molecule or aerosol spends in the atmosphere after it is released or generated there. For compounds with well defined sources and emission rates, this is estimated by the ratio of the average global concentration of a substance to its production rate on a global scale. It is a function of not only the emission rates but the loss rates by chemical and physical removal processes.

It is recommended that one of three values 50%, 5% or 0.5% should always be used. For an isolated symmetrical peak recorded with a system which is linear in the range between 5% and 10% levels of the peak, the 5% peak width definition is technically equivalent to the 10% valley definition. A common standard is the definition of resolution based upon being Full Width of the peak at Half its Maximum height, sometimes abbreviated 'FWHM'. This acronym should preferably be defined the first time it is used.

A measure of the time the sample component resides in the stationary phase relative to the time it resides in the mobile phase; it expresses how much longer a sample component is retarded by the stationary phase than it would take to travel through the column with the velocity of the mobile phase. Mathematically, it is the ratio of the adjusted retention volume (time) and the hold-up volume (time):

It should be emphasized that all the recognized nomenclatures (IUPAC, BS, ASTM) have always clearly identified the capacity factor

peak of interest:

The Kováts (retention) index expresses the number of carbon atoms (multiplied by 100) of a hypothetical normal alkane which would have an adjusted retention volume (time) identical to that of the peak of interest when analysed under identical conditions. The Kováts retention index is always measured under isothermal conditions. In the case of temperature-programmed gas chromatography a similar value can be calculated utilizing direct numbers instead of their logarithm. Since both the numerator and denominator contain the difference of two values, here we can use the total retention volumes (times). Sometimes this value is called the linear retention index.

Retention measurements (and measurements of hold-up volume and peak width) may be made in terms of times or chart distances as well as volumes. If flow and recorder speeds are constant, the volumes are directly proportional to the times and chart distances. The following definitions are drawn up in terms of volume, and it is recommended that theoretical discussion should be couched in the same terms wherever possible. The total retention volume, , is the volume of eluent carrier gas admitted to the column between the injection of the sample and the emergence of the peak maximum of the specified component. It includes the hold-up volume. In gas chromatography, the volume of carrier gas is specified at the outlet pressure and temperature of the column. Note: the word 'total' in this definition allows retention time to be used as a general term when specification of a particular quantity is not required.

,  (sigma, pi)
The terms are symmetry designations,  molecular orbitals being antisymmetric with respect to a defining plane containing at least one atom (e.g. the molecular plane of ethene) and  molecular orbitals symmetric with respect to the same plane. In practice the terms are used both in this rigorous sense (for orbitals encompassing the entire molecule) and also for localized two-centre orbitals or bonds, and it is necessary to make a clear distinction between the two usages. In the case of twocentre bonds, a -bond has a nodal plane that includes the internuclear bond axis, whereas a -bond has no such nodal plane. (A -bond in organometallic or inorganic molecular species has two nodes.) Radicals are classified by analogy into - and -radicals. Such two-centre orbitals may take part in molecular orbitals of - or -symmetry. For example, the methyl group in propene contains three C­ H bonds, each of which is of local -symmetry (i.e. without a nodal plane including the internuclear axis), but these three '-bonds' can in turn be combined to form a set of group orbitals one of which has -symmetry with respect to the principal molecular plane and can accordingly interact with the two-centre orbital of -symmetry (-bond) of the double-bonded carbon atoms, to form a molecular orbital of -symmetry. Such an interaction between the CH3 group and the double bond is an example of what is called hyperconjugation. This cannot rigorously be described as '­ conjugation' since  and  here refer to different defining planes, and interaction between orbitals of different symmetries (with respect to the same defining plane) is forbidden.

sample
in analytical chemistry
A portion of material selected from a larger quantity of material. The term needs to be qualified, e.g. bulk sample, representative sample, primary sample, bulked sample, test sample. The term 'sample' implies the existence of a sampling error, i.e. the results obtained on the portions taken are only estimates of the concentration of a constituent or the quantity of a property present in the parent material. If there is no or negligible sampling error, the portion removed is a test portion, aliquot or specimen. The term 'specimen' is used to denote a portion taken under conditions such that the sampling variability cannot be assessed (usually because the population is changing), and is assumed, for convenience, to be zero. The manner of selection of the sample should be prescribed in a sampling plan.

sampling error
That part of the total error (the estimate from a sample minus the population value) associated with using only a fraction of the population and extrapolating to the whole, as distinct from analytical or test error. It arises from a lack of homogeneity in the parent population. In chemical analysis, the final test result reflects the value only as it exists in the test portion. It is usually assumed that no sampling error is introduced in preparing the test sample from the laboratory sample. Therefore, the sampling error is usually associated exclusively with the variability of the laboratory sample. Sampling error is determined by replication of the laboratory samples and their multiple analyses. Since sampling error is always associated with analytical error, it must be isolated by the statistical procedure of analysis of variance.

secondary isotope effect
A kinetic isotope effect that is attributable to isotopic substitution of an atom to which bonds are neither made nor broken in the rate-controlling step or in a pre-equilibrium step of a specified reaction, and is therefore not a primary isotope effect. One speaks of , , (etc.) secondary isotope effects, where , , (etc.) denote the position of isotopic substitution relative to the reaction centre. The corresponding isotope effect on the equilibrium constant of such a reaction is called a 'secondary equilibrium isotope effect'. Secondary isotope effects have been discussed in terms of the conventional electronic effects of physical organic chemistry, e.g. induction, hyperconjugation, hybridization, etc., since these properties are determined by the electron distribution, that depends on vibrationally averaged bond lengths and angles which vary slightly with isotopic substitution. While this usage is legitimate, the term 'electronic isotope effect' should be avoided, because of the misleading implication that such an effect is electronic rather than vibrational in origin.

self-absorption
Occurs in emission sources of finite thickness when radiant energy quanta emitted by atoms (or molecules) are absorbed by atoms of the same kind present in the same source. The absorbed energy is usually dissipated by collisional transfer of energy, or through emission of radiant energy of the same or other frequencies. In consequence, the observed radiant intensity of a spectral line (or band component) emitted by a source may be less than the radiant intensity would be from an optically thin source having the same number of emitting atoms. Self-absorption may occur in all emitting sources to some degree, whether they are homogeneous or not.

sensitivity
in mass spectrometry
Two different measures of sensitivity are recommended. The first, which is suitable for relatively involatile materials as well as gases, depends upon the observed change in ion current for a particular amount or change of flow rate of sample though the ion source. A second method of stating sensitivity, that is most suitable for gases, depends upon the change of ion current related to the change of partial pressure of the sample in the ion source. It is important that the relevant experimental conditions corresponding to sensitivity measurement should always be stated. These include in a typical case details of the instrument type, bombarding electron current, slit dimensions, angular collimation, gain of the multiplier detector, scan speed and whether the measured signal corresponds to a single mass peak or to the ion beam integrated over all masses. Some indication of the time involved in the determination should be given, e.g. counting time or band width. The sensitivity should be differentiated from the detection limit.

sensitivity,
in metrology and analytical chemistry
The slope of the calibration curve. If the curve is in fact a 'curve', rather than a straight line, then of course sensitivity will be a function of analyte concentration or amount. If sensitivity is to be a unique performance characteristic, it must depend only on the chemical measurement process, not upon scale factors.

sigmatropic rearrangement
A molecular rearrangement that involves both the creation of a new -bond between atoms previously not directly linked and the breaking of an existing -bond. There is normally a concurrent relocation of -bonds in the molecule concerned, but the total number of - and - bonds does not change. The term was originally restricted to intramolecular pericyclic reactions, and many authors use it with this connotation. It is, however, also applied in a more general, purely structural, sense. If such reactions are intramolecular, their transition state may be visualized as an association of two fragments connected at their termini by two partial -bonds, one being broken and the other being formed as, for example, the two allyl fragments in (a'). Considering only atoms within the (real or hypothetical) cyclic array undergoing reorganization, if the numbers of these in the two fragments are designated
and , then the rearrangement is said to be a sigmatropic change of order [ , ] (conventionally
). Thus the rearrangement (a) is of order [3,3], whilst reaction (b) is a [1,5]sigmatropic shift of hydrogen. (N.B. By convention square brackets [...] here refer to numbers of atoms, in contrast with current usage in the context of cycloaddition.)

single-photon timing
Technique that permits recovery of the parameters characterizing a fluorescence decay after pulse excitation (in particular excited-states lifetimes). It is based on the creation of a time histogram of many stochastic events involving the time delay between the electronic excitation of a molecule or material and its emission of a photon from an excited state. A key to the technique is that no more than one photon strike the detector per pulsed excitation. Excitation is commonly achieved with a flash from a repetitive nanosecond lamp or diode laser or a CW operated laser (mode-locked laser). The essential components of the hardware are a device to measure the excitation-emission delay time and another to determine the relative frequency of photons reaching the detector at each delay time. Delay times are usually measured with a time-to-amplitude-converter (TAC), using voltage to measure the delay between a start and a stop signal. The frequency of events with each delay is stored in a multi-channel analyser. This term is preferred to time-correlated single-photon counting.

solubility parameter,
Parameter used in predicting the solubility of non-electrolytes (including polymers) in a given solvent. For a substance ,

where

is the molar energy of vaporization at zero pressure and

is the molar volume.

Notes:

1. For a substance of low molecular weight, the value of the solubility parameter can be estimated

most reliably from the enthalpy of vaporization and the molar volume.

2. The solubility of a substance B can be related to the square of the difference between the solubility

parameters for supercooled liquid B and solvent at a given temperature, with appropriate

allowances for entropy of mixing. Thus, a value can be estimated from the solubility of the solid

in a series of solvents of known solubility parameter. For a polymer, it is usually taken to be the

value of the solubility parameter of the solvent producing the solution with maximum intrinsic

viscosity or maximum swelling of a network of the polymer. See J.H. Hildebrand, R.L.Scott, The

Solubility of Nonelectrolytes, 3rd ed., Reinhold Publishing (1950); Dover Publications (1964),

solute-volatilization interference
in flame spectroscopy
Interference due to changes in the volatilization rate of the dry aerosol particles in the case when volatilization of the analyte is incomplete in the presence and/or absence of the concomitant. This interference can either be specific, if the analyte and interferent form a new phase of different thermostability, as when Mg and Al form MgAl2O4 in an air­acetylene flame, or non-specific, if the analyte is simply dispersed in a large excess of the interferent, as when Ag is dispersed in ThO2. If the interferent has a high boiling point, this latter is sometimes referred to as a blocking interference. It is often difficult to make sharp distinctions between the specific and non-specific solute-volatilization interferences.

solution
Also contains definition of: solvent
A liquid or solid phase containing more than one substance, when for convenience one (or more) substance, which is called the solvent, is treated differently from the other substances, which are called solutes. When, as is often but not necessarily the case, the sum of the mole fractions of solutes is small compared with unity, the solution is called a dilute solution. A superscript attached to the symbol for a property of a solution denotes the property in the limit of infinite dilution.

solvation
Any stabilizing interaction of a solute (or solute moiety) and the solvent or a similar interaction of solvent with groups of an insoluble material (i.e. the ionic groups of an ion-exchange resin).

solvent parameter
Quantitative measures of the capability of solvents for interaction with solutes. Such parameters have been based on numerous different physicochemical quantities, e.g. rate constants, solvatochromic shifts in ultraviolet/visible spectra, solvent-induced shifts in infrared frequencies, etc. Some solvent parameters are purely empirical in nature, i.e. they are based directly on some experimental measurement. It may be possible to interpret such a parameter as measuring some particular aspect of solvent­solute interaction or it may be regarded simply as a measure of solvent polarity. Other solvent parameters are based on analysing experimental results. Such a parameter is considered to quantify some particular aspect of solvent capability for interaction with solutes.

The methods enable analyses of microamounts of substances. Ion-exchange chromatography is not widely used owing to the great volumes of solutions being treated and, consequently, to a great degree to the variation in the blank, and to some diffusional limitations. Static ion-exchange, which is much simpler and more readily carried out, is practised quite widely.

A type of molecular magnetism that is the result of electronic instability (see electronic stability)

caused by external constraints (temperature, pressure, or electromagnetic radiation), which induce

structural changes at molecular and lattice levels. The phenomenon is most characteristic of first-row

spin polarization
Static and dynamic spin polarization effects are distinguished. The static polarization of an electron spin occurs in the C­H bonds of aromatic radicals where the -electron closest to an unpaired electron tends to have its spin parallel to that of the -electron. Likewise, static spin polarization arises in the -system of conjugated radicals: the electron of the doubly occupied molecular orbital prefers to take a closer spatial position to the odd one, which spin is parallel to the latter. The effect reflects the energy unfavourable situation if an electron of opposite spin were to come nearby.

spin trapping
Also contains definitions of: spin adduct, spin counting
In certain reactions in solution a transient radical will interact with a diamagnetic reagent to form a more persistent radical. The product radical accumulates to a concentration where detection and, frequently, identification are possible by EPR/ESR spectroscopy. The key reaction is usually one of attachment; the diamagnetic reagent is said to be a 'spin trap' and the persistent product radical is then the 'spin adduct'. The procedure is referred to as spin trapping, and is used for monitoring reactions involving the intermediacy of reactive radicals at concentrations too low for direct observation. Typical spin traps are C-nitroso compounds and nitrones, to which reactive radicals will rapidly add to form nitryl radicals. A quantitative development, in which essentially all reactive radicals generated in a particular system are intercepted, has been referred to as 'spin counting'. Spin trapping has also been adapted to the interception of radicals generated in both gaseous and solid phases. In these cases the spin adduct is in practice transferred to a liquid solution for observation in order to facilitate interpretation of the EPR/ESR spectra of the radicals obtained.

stable

As applied to chemical species, the term expresses a thermodynamic property, which is quantitatively

measured by relative molar standard Gibbs energies. A chemical species A is more stable than its

isomer B if

for the (real or hypothetical) reaction

, under standard conditions. If for the two reactions:

, P is more stable relative to the product Y than is Q relative to Z. Both in qualitative
and quantitative usage the term stable is therefore always used in reference to some explicitly stated or implicitly assumed standard. The term should not be used as a synonym for unreactive or 'less reactive' since this confuses thermodynamics and kinetics. A relatively more stable chemical species may be more reactive than some reference species towards a given reaction partner. See also: inert, unstable

The expression chromatographic bed or sorbent may be used as a general term to denote any of the different forms in which the stationary phase is used. Particularly in gas chromatography where the stationary phase is most often a liquid, the term liquid phase is used for it as compared to the gas phase, i.e. the mobile phase. However, particularly in the early development of liquid chromatography, the term 'liquid phase' had also been used to characterize the mobile phase as compared to the 'solid phase' i.e. the stationary phase. Due to this ambiguity, the use of the term 'liquid phase' is discouraged. If the physical state of the stationary phase is to be expressed, the use of the adjective forms such as liquid stationary phase and solid stationary phase, bonded phase or immobilized phase is proposed.

A grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism. At least one of these must be present in every enantiomer (though the presence of stereogenic units does not conversely require the corresponding chemical species to be chiral). Three basic types are recognized for molecular entities involving atoms having not more than four substituents: 1. A grouping of atoms consisting of a central atom and distinguishable ligands, such that the
interchange of any two of the substituents leads to a stereoisomer. An asymmetric atom (chirality centre) is the traditional example of this stereogenic unit. 2. A chain of four non-coplanar atoms (or rigid groups) in a stable conformation, such that an imaginary or real (restricted) rotation (with a change of sign of the torsion angle) about the central bond leads to a stereoisomer. 3.

stereospecificity (stereospecific)
1. A reaction is termed stereospecific if starting materials differing only in their configuration are converted into stereoisomeric products. According to this definition, a stereospecific process is necessarily stereoselective but not all stereoselective processes are stereospecific. Stereospecificity may be total (100%) or partial. The term is also applied to situations where reaction can be performed with only one stereoisomer. For example, the exclusive formation of trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane upon bromination of cyclohexene is a stereospecific process, although the analogous reaction with (E)-cyclohexene has not been performed.
2. The term has also been applied to describe a reaction of very high stereoselectivity, but this usage is unnecessary and is discouraged.

steric effect
The effect on a chemical or physical property (structure, rate or equilibrium constant) upon introduction of substituents having different steric requirements. The steric effect in a reaction is ascribed to the difference in steric energy between, on the one hand, reactants and, on the other hand, a transition state (or products). A steric effect on a rate process may result in a rate increase ('steric acceleration') or a decrease ('steric retardation'). (The adjective 'steric' is not to be confused with stereochemical.) Steric effects arise from contributions ascribed to strain as the sum of (1) non-bonded repulsions, (2) bond angle strain and (3) bond stretches or compressions. For the purpose of correlation analysis or linear free-energy relations various scales of steric parameters have been proposed, notably A values, Taft's and Charton's scales. In a reactant molecule RY and an appropriate reference molecule RoY , the 'primary steric effect' of R is the direct result of differences in compressions which

occur because R differs from Ro in the vicinity of the reaction centre Y . A 'secondary steric effect' involves the differential moderation of electron delocalization by non-bonded compressions. Some authors make a distinction between 'steric' effects attributed to van der Waals repulsions alone, and 'strain' effects, attributed to deviations of bond angles from 'ideal' values.

Stern­Volmer kinetic relationships
This term applies broadly to variations of quantum yields of photophysical processes (e.g. fluorescence or phosphorescence ) or photochemical reactions (usually reaction quantum yield) with the concentration of a given reagent which may be a substrate or a quencher. In the simplest case, a
plot of (or for emission) vs. concentration of quencher, , is linear obeying the equation:

Equation (1) applies when a quencher inhibits either a photochemical reaction or a photophysical process by a single reaction. and are the quantum yield and emission intensity radiant exitance, respectively, in the absence of the quencher Q, while and are the same quantities in the presence of the different concentrations of Q. In the case of dynamic quenching the constant is the product of the true quenching constant
and the excited state lifetime, , in the absence of quencher. is the bimolecular reaction rate constant for the elementary reaction of the excited state with the particular quencher Q. Equation (1) can therefore be replaced by the expression (2):
When an excited state undergoes a bimolecular reaction with rate constant to form a product, a double-reciprocal relationship is observed according to the equation:

where is the quantum efficiency of product formation, the efficiency of forming the reactive
excited state, the fraction of reactions of the excited state with substrate S which leads to product,
and is the concentration of reactive ground-state substrate. The intercept/slope ratio gives . If
, and if a photophysical process is monitored, plots of equations (2) and (3) should provide independent determinations of the product-forming rate constant .

where is the lifetime of the excited state in the absence of the quencher Q. See also: self-quenching

Sometimes stoichiometric quantities are indicated by a subscript ( ), e.g. , . In clinical chemistry, the term stoichiometric concentration is rarely employed. Instead, the name of the component is modified to indicate inclusion of the various derived forms, e.g. mixtures of a defined chemical component and its derivatives may be denoted by the plural form of the name of the pure unchanged substance, or to indicate the sum of components specified in individual quantities the specification 'total' may be employed.

stoichiometry
The term refers to the relationship between the amounts of substances that react together in a particular chemical reaction, and the amounts of products that are formed. The general stoichiometric equation:
provides the information that a moles of A reacts with b moles of B to produce y moles of Y and z moles of Z. The stoichiometry of a reaction may be unknown, or may be very complex. For example, the thermal decomposition of acetaldehyde yields mainly methane and carbon monoxide, but also a variety of minor products such as ethane, acetone and diacetyl. The stoichiometric equation:

is therefore only an approximate one. Even when the overall stoichiometry of a reaction is well

defined, it may be time-dependent in that it varies during the course of a reaction. Thus if a reaction

occurs by the mechanism

, and X is formed in substantial amounts during the course

of the process, the relationship between the amounts of A, X and Y will vary with time, and no one

stoichiometric equation can represent the reaction at all times.

Strain is present in a molecular entity or transition structure if the energy is enhanced because of unfavourable bond lengths, bond angles or dihedral angles ('torsional strain') relative to a standard.

strain energy
The excess energy due to steric strain of a molecular entity or transition state structure, i.e. distortions relative to a reference (real or hypothetical) 'strainless' structure with the standard bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles. The strain energy components involve the following destabilizing terms: non-bonded repulsions, bond-angle distortions, bond stretch or compression, rotation around or twisting of double bonds, and electrostatic strain. In general, the contributions of these components are inseparable and interdependent. A quantitative assessment of strain and strain energies can be made by taking the difference between the heat of formation of the substance under consideration and that of a hypothetical strain-free model. Several approaches to the assessment of strain energies have been developed based on the use of energies of isodesmic and homodesmotic reactions and on the socalled 'strainless increments', i.e. heats of formation of certain groups (CH3, CH2, CH, C etc).

stray radiation error
in spectrochemical analysis
A spectrometer set to pass radiation of a particular wavelength band always has a small amount of stray radiation of other wavelengths. Since the sample may absorb more (or less) of this stray radiation than of the radiation at the selected wavelength an error can occur. This error is called a stray radiation error.

stripping
The process of removing solute(s) from a loaded solvent or extract. Generally this refers to the main solute(s) present. Notes: 1. Where appropriate, e.g. when liquid-liquid distribution is used for stripping, the term
back-extraction can be used. The terms back-washing and re-extraction are not recommended. 2. The recent application of selective stripping of solutes as a separation method leads to some
confusion between the terms stripping and scrubbing. It is recommended that the term scrubbing be reserved for the operation of removing contaminants (impurities) from an extract (where the scrub raffinate is often recycled to the loading step) and the term selective stripping be used where two or more main solutes are stripped successively from an extract, usually with different stripping agents, with a view to their subsequent separate recovery from solution for analysis.

summit current
in polarography
In ac polarography, differential pulse polarography, derivative polarography, square-wave polarography, and similar techniques, the maximum value of the component of the current that is associated with the presence of a substance B. Normally this component of the current is faradaic, and the maximum arises because the rate of variation (with applied potential ) of the rate of the charge-transfer process passes through a maximum. Similar maxima arise when this component is non-faradaic (and when B is surface-active rather than electroactive). In a case known to be of the latter type, the term apex current is recommended as being more specific.

suspension effect
in an ion-selective electrode
An effect which occurs when ion-selective electrodes are used in concentrated, space-filled suspensions while the external reference electrode remains in the supernatant (suspension-free) solution. The suspensions are specifically solvent-swollen ion exchangers or other materials, like soils and clays, that concentrate ions by adsorption and absorption. Space-filled, gravity-packed suspensions act like a second phase and form apparently an interfacial potential difference (PD) with respect to the supernatant. The measured ion activity in the suspension differs from the value in the supernatant by the interfacial PD, and corresponds to a higher value approximating the activity inside the ion exchanger gel. The effect nearly disappears when the outer reference electrode is placed in the same region of the suspension as the sensor electrode. There are some changes in the junction potential differences of the reference electrode, between suspension and supernatant.

synchronization (principle of nonperfect synchronization)
This principle applies to reactions in which there is a lack of synchronization between bond formation or bond rupture and other primitive changes that affect the stability of products and reactants, such as resonance, solvation, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and polarizability effects. The principle states that a product-stabilizing factor whose development lags behind bond changes at the transition state, or a reactant-stabilizing factor whose loss is ahead of bond changes at the transition state, increases the intrinsic barrier and decreases the 'intrinsic rate constant' of a reaction. For a product-stabilizing factor whose development is ahead of bond changes, or reactant factors whose loss lags behind bond changes, the opposite relations hold. The reverse effects are observable for factors that destabilize a reactant or product. See also: imbalance, synchronous

synchronous
A concerted process in which the primitive changes concerned (generally bond rupture and bond formation) have progressed to the same extent at the transition state is said to be synchronous. The term figuratively implies a more or less synchronized progress of the changes. However, the progress of the bonding change (or other primitive change) has not been defined quantitatively in terms of a single parameter applicable to different bonds or different bonding changes. The concept is therefore in general only qualitatively descriptive and does not admit an exact definition except in the case of concerted processes involving changes in two identical bonds.

The temperature increases as a function of height in this case. Poor mixing of the pollutants generally occurs below the inversion, since the normal convective process which drives the warmer and lighter air at ground level to higher altitudes is interrupted as the rising air parcels encounter the warmer air above. Temperature inversions near the surface are particularly effective in trapping ground level emissions.

thermodynamic isotope effect
The effect of isotopic substitution on an equilibrium constant is referred to as a thermodynamic (or equilibrium) isotope effect. For example, the effect of isotopic substitution in reactant A that participates in the equilibrium:
is the ratio of the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which A contains the light isotope to that in which it contains the heavy isotope. The ratio can be expressed as the equilibrium constant for the isotopic exchange reaction:
in which reactants such as B that are not isotopically substituted do not appear. The potential energy surfaces of isotopic molecules are identical to a high degree of approximation, so thermodynamic isotope effects can only arise from the effect of isotopic mass on the nuclear motions of the reactants and products, and can be expressed quantitatively in terms of partition function ratios for nuclear motion:

Although the nuclear partition function is a product of the translational, rotational and vibrational partition functions, the isotope effect is determined almost entirely by the last named, specifically by vibrational modes involving motion of isotopically different atoms. In the case of light atoms (i.e. protium vs. deuterium or tritium) at moderate temperatures, the isotope effect is dominated by zeropoint energy differences. See also: isotopic fractionation factor

thermometric titration
Synonym: enthalpimetric titration
An analytical method in which one reactant (the titrant) is added continuously or stepwise to an adiabatic or isoperibol vessel containing another reactant. The enthalpy change(s) of the ensuing reaction(s) causes a temperature change which, when plotted versus volume of titrant, may be used to find the titration endpoint(s). This is the preferred term for experiments producing plots of temperature versus volume of titrant in which the main goal is a quantitative determination. Nonetheless, when a calorimetric vessel is used, such that the heat capacity is known, thermodynamic parameters may also be estimated from such experiments. An acceptable synonym in that case is enthalpimetric titration. The use of the adjective thermometric is justified because of widespread historical and current usage, and because a titration of necessity implies a chemical reaction. The term thermometric enthalpy titration has been used, but is not recommended. A method in which the titrant is a catalyst for an indicator reaction that occurs after the endpoint for the analyte reaction should be called a thermometric titration with catalytic endpoint detection, not a catalytic thermometric titration.

If the endpoint coincides with the

torsion angle
Also contains definitions of: anticlinal, antiperiplanar, clinal, periplanar, synclinal, synperiplanar
In a chain of atoms A-B-C-D, the dihedral angle between the plane containing the atoms A,B,C and that containing B,C,D. In a Newman projection the torsion angle is the angle (having an absolute value between 0° and 180°) between bonds to two specified (fiducial) groups, one from the atom nearer (proximal) to the observer and the other from the further (distal) atom. The torsion angle between groups A and D is then considered to be positive if the bond A-B is rotated in a clockwise direction through less than 180° in order that it may eclipse the bond C-D: a negative torsion angle requires rotation in the opposite sense. Stereochemical arrangements corresponding to torsion angles between 0° and ±90° are called syn (s), those corresponding to torsion angles between ±90° and 180° anti (a). Similarly, arrangements corresponding to torsion angles between 30° and 150° or between -30° and -150° are called clinal (c) and those between 0° and 30° or 150° and 180° are called periplanar (p). The two types of terms can be combined so as to define four ranges of torsion angle; 0° to 30° synperiplanar (sp); 30° to 90° and -30° to -90° synclinal (sc); 90° to 150°, and -90° to -150° anticlinal (ac); ±150° to 180° antiperiplanar (ap).

The synperiplanar conformation is also known as the syn- or cis-conformation; antiperiplanar as anti or trans and synclinal as gauche or skew. For macromolecular usage the symbols , , , , and are recommended (ap, sp, +sc, -sc, +ac and -ac respectively).

transition (dipole) moment
Also contains definition of: electronic transition moment
An electromagnetic wave may induce an oscillating electric moment in a molecule (possibly leading to absorption if the oscillation frequency is equal to the light frequency). The amplitude of this moment is the transition momentbetween the initial (i) and final (f) states (here assumed to be non-degenerate):

where

is the electric dipole moment operator, a vector operator that is the sum of the position

vectors of all charged particles weighted with their charge. The transition moment is a vector in

the molecular framework, characterized both by its direction and its probability. Notes: 1. The absorption probability for linearly polarized light is proportional to the cosine square of the
angle between the electric vector of the electromagnetic wave and ; light absorption will be

maximized if they are parallel, and no absorption will occur if they are perpendicular. 2. It is frequently said that a transition is polarized along the direction of its transition moment and
this direction is called the polarization direction of the transition. 3. In the case of a doubly degenerate final state f, each of the two components at the same energy
has a transition moment and the two moments define a plane. The transition is then said to be polarized in that plane, which also defines its polarization direction(s). This is typically the case for some of the transitions in highly symmetrical molecules. 4. In the case of a vibronic transition, where both the initial and the final states may be characterized by (different) electronic and vibrational states, the Franck­Condon principle is often applied. This approximation separates electronic and nuclear descriptions and allows the transition moment to be written as a product of a purely electronic transition moment and an overlap integral between the two vibrational wavefunctions involved.

Any intermediate species in an elementary reaction. An activated complex is an example of a transition species, but the latter term also includes other intermediate species.

transition state
In theories describing elementary reactions it is usually assumed that there is a transition state of more positive molar Gibbs energy between the reactants and the products through which an assembly of atoms (initially composing the molecular entities of the reactants) must pass on going from reactants to products in either direction. In the formalism of 'transition state theory' the transition state of an elementary reaction is that set of states (each characterized by its own geometry and energy) in which an assembly of atoms, when randomly placed there, would have an equal probability of forming the reactants or of forming the products of that elementary reaction. The transition state is characterized by one and only one imaginary frequency. The assembly of atoms at the transition state has been called an activated complex. (It is not a complex according to the definition in this Compendium.) It may be noted that the calculations of reaction rates by the transition state method and based on calculated potential-energy surfaces refer to the potential energy maximum at the saddle point, as this is the only point for which the requisite separability of transition state coordinates may be assumed. The ratio of the number of assemblies of atoms that pass through to the products to the number of those that reach the saddle point from the reactants can be less than unity, and this fraction is the 'transmission

umpolung
Any process by which the normal alternating donor and acceptor reactivity pattern of a chain, which is due to the presence of O or N heteroatoms, is interchanged.

wavelength converter
A wavelength converter converts radiation at one wavelength to radiation at another detectable wavelength or at a wavelength of improved responsivity of the detector. The classical wavelength converter consists of a screen of luminescent material that absorbs radiation and radiates at a longer wavelength.

In X-ray spectroscopy a converter that emits optical radiation is called a scintillator. In most cases wavelength conversion is from short to long wavelength, but in the case of conversion of long to short wavelength the process is sometimes called upconversion. Wavelengths of coherent sources can be converted using nonlinear optical techniques. A typical example is frequency doubling.

X-ray intensity
Essentially all X-ray measurements are made by photon counting techniques but the results are seldom converted to radiant flux or irradiance or radiant exposure. The term photon flux would be appropriate if the measurements were corrected for detector efficiency but this is seldom done for X-ray chemical analysis. Therefore the term X-ray intensity, , is commonly used and expressed as photons/unit time detected. Likewise the term relative X-ray intensity, , is used to mean the intensity for the analyte in an unknown specimen divided by the intensity for a known concentration of the analyte element.

X-ray satellite
Also contains definitions of: hypersatellite in X-ray spectroscopy, multiple ionization satellite in X-ray spectroscopy , non-diagram line in X-ray spectroscopy
A weak line in the same energy region as a normal X-ray line. Another name used for weak features is non-diagram line. Recommendations as to the use of these two terms have conflicted. Using the term diagram line as defined here, non-diagram line may well be used for all lines with a different origin. The majority of these lines originate form the dipole-allowed de-excitation of multiply ionized or excited states, and are called multiple-ionization satellites. A line where the initial state has two vacencies in the same shell, notably the K-shell, is called a hypersatellite. Other mechanisms leading to weak spectral features in X-ray emission are, e.g. resonance emission, the radiative Auger effect, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transitions and, in metals, plasmon excitation. Atoms with open electron shells, i.e. transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, show a splitting of certain Xray lines due to the electron interaction involving this open shell. Structures originating in all these ways as well as structures in the valence band of molecules and solid chemical compounds have in the past been given satellite designations.

ylides
Also contains definition of: nitrogen ylides
Compounds in which an anionic site Y- (originally on carbon, but now including other atoms) is attached directly to a heteroatom X+ (usually nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur) carrying a formal positive charge. They are thus 1,2-dipolar species of the type RmX+­Y-Rn. If X is a saturated atom of an element from the first row of the periodic system, the ylide is commonly represented by a chargeseparated form; if X is a second, third, etc. row element uncharged canonical forms are available RmX=YRn. If X is an unsaturated atom, doubly bonded to another first row element Z, the negative charge on Y may be stabilized by -conjugation, Z=X+­Y-Rn Z-­X+=YRn. Such ylides belong to the class 1,3 dipolar compounds. However, 1,3-dipolar compounds with only sextet-containing canonical forms (e.g. vinylcarbenes ) are not ylides. E.g. Ph3P+­C-H2 Ph3P+=CH2 (often called a Wittig reagent), (CH3)3N+­C-H2, RCN+N-­R, (CH3)2S=CHPh (CH3)2S+­C-HPh. Note that ylide is a complete word, not to be confused with the suffix -ylide, used for some radical anions. Subclasses of ylides: Ylides RmX+­C-R2 having the negative charge on carbon are classified by citing the name of the element X before the word ylide. E.g. nitrogen ylide, phosphorus ylide, oxygen ylide, sulfur ylide. A further specification may be achieved by citing the class name of RmX before the word ylide. Thus nitrogen ylides include amine ylides, R3N+­C-R2, azomethine ylides R2C=N+R­C-R2, nitrile ylides, RCN+­C-R2. Some authors, who wish to express the positive charge on X, prefer e.g. ammonium ylides over amine ylides; such usage varies according to the heteroatom X and to national custom. The ylides RmX+­Y- RmX=Y (Y = O, S, Se, Te, NR) are usually named by citing the name of RmX followed by the additive nomenclature term for Y (oxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride, imide, respectively). E.g. amine imides; use of the less systematic synonyms amine imines
